<p>“Mother, make Trouble stop!”</p>

<p>“What is he doing now, Janet?” asked
Mrs. Martin, looking up from her sewing
and across the table to where her three children
were playing a button game.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s doing <i>everything</i>!” said Teddy,
shaking a finger at his funny little brother,
who was smiling and holding something in
his tightly closed fist. “He’s got some of
my buttons, and he——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he knocked a lot of my buttons
down on the floor,” added Janet. “And
he——”</p>

<p>“I must have all de wed buttons!” interrupted
Trouble himself. “Wed buttons all
mine—I goin’ to put ’em on a stwing!” and
the little boy, whose name was William, but
who was more often called “Trouble,” made
a grab for another red button which he saw
in a pile in front of his sister Janet.</p>

<p>“Don’t take that!” cried Janet. “Ma—I
mean Mother—please make him stop!” and
she tried to push Trouble’s hand away.</p>

<p>“Wed buttons all mine!” cried Trouble,
just a trace of tears coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>“No, Trouble,” said Ted, more gently.
“Let sister have the red buttons. We’re
playing a game with them. I’ll let you take
all the white buttons!”</p>

<p>“I want wed buttons!” wailed Trouble,
and as he still tried to get a handful of them
from Janet, and as Janet was doing her
best to stop William from doing this, there
was a little scramble at the table. Trouble’s
hand slipped, the buttons slid across the
smooth oak boards and fell with a clatter to
the floor.</p>

<p>“There! Now look what you did, Trouble
Martin!” cried Janet, as she leaned back in
her chair. “All the nice buttons are on the
floor!”</p>

<p>Trouble seemed much surprised by what
he had done. He opened his fat little fist,
and out rolled more buttons, some of which
rattled to the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, he’s spoiling all our game!”
said Janet. “Please make him stop!”</p>

<p>“I’ll pick up the buttons,” said Teddy,
with a sigh. “I guess this is about fifty
times I’ve done it to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hardly as many as that, I think,”
said his mother, with a smile, as she thrust
her needle into the cloth she was sewing.
“You must not exaggerate, Teddy.”</p>

<p>“What’s zaggerate, Mother?” asked
Janet. “Is that a new game you can play
with buttons?”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” answered Mrs. Martin, as she
laid aside her sewing and looked at the clock.
“To exaggerate means to tell what isn’t exactly
so so as to make anything seem bigger
than it is. Now I don’t really believe you
have picked the buttons off the floor more
than five times to-night, have you, Teddy?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it was—maybe it was—<i>six</i>!”
replied the curly-headed little lad.</p>

<p>“And you said <i>fifty</i>!” laughed his mother.
“That’s exaggeration—making a thing too
big, Teddy, my boy!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Henderson that lives across the
street is zaggerated, isn’t she, Mother?”
asked Janet, as Teddy was busy picking up
the buttons Trouble had knocked to the
floor.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Henderson exaggerated? Why,
Jan, what do you mean?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“I mean she’s awful big—fat, you know,”
explained the little girl. “She’s zaggerated
all right, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t mean <i>that</i> at all!” said
Mrs. Martin, trying not to laugh. “And
you mustn’t say ‘awful’ when you mean
only ‘very much,’ Janet. That’s exaggeration,
too. But, Trouble, I think it’s time
for you to go to bed. I’ll take him upstairs,”
she said to the two older children, “and then
you can play your game a little longer without
any one to bother you. Come, Trouble,
dear!”</p>

<p>“Ho! Don’t want to go to bed! I want
wed buttons!” and the little boy tried to
reach over the table to where Ted had placed
a pile of buttons of different colors.</p>

<p>“Ho, William! Come with mother,” said
Mrs. Martin quietly. When she used any of
the children’s real names—such as William,
Theodore or Janet, instead of Trouble, Ted
or Jan, the little folks knew Mrs. Martin was
in earnest and that it was useless to beg further.
Trouble heard his right name spoken
and he gave a long sigh. Bedtime had come
after a long, happy day.</p>

<p>“Could I have one more wed button?” he
asked wistfully.</p>

<p>“No more,” answered his mother.</p>

<p>“All wite. Den I go to bed!”</p>

<p>He slipped down from his chair, as Ted
began putting the buttons from his mother’s
mending bag into two piles, so that he and
Janet might go on with the game.</p>

<p>“Give sister a kiss!” begged Janet of
Trouble.</p>

<p>He held back a moment, as if he had not
quite forgiven her for not letting him have
all the fun he wanted, and then he held up his
chubby face.</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy!” said Janet as she
kissed him. “I’ll let you have a lot of red
buttons in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Night-night!” called Trouble to Ted, as
the older boy began counting out the buttons.</p>

<p>“Night-night,” echoed Ted, as he wiggled
his fingers in a funny fashion at Trouble.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Martin took William up to bed,
Ted and Janet started their game over again.
It was a simple little game. They spread
out on the table all the buttons from
mother’s bag. Then they divided them into
two piles, each taking one.</p>

<p>Janet would then take a button from her
pile and hold it in her hand with her fingers
closed over it so Teddy could not see it.</p>

<p>“Guess what color it is!” Jan would say to
Ted.</p>

<p>“Black,” he might answer, or perhaps he
would say red, blue, or white—whatever he
thought it might be. If he guessed the right
color Janet had to give Ted five buttons of
the color he had guessed. If he said the
wrong color he had to give Janet seven buttons
of any color she wanted.</p>

<p>If Ted guessed right, then it was his turn
to take a button and make Janet guess the
color of it. But if he guessed wrong it was
his sister’s turn again. And so they played
the game, taking turns this way, until they
were tired, or until one of them had all the
buttons on the table.</p>

<p>It was this game they had been playing
when Trouble, or Baby William, made the
trouble by wanting all the “wed” buttons.</p>

<p>They played the little game for some time,
having lots of fun, and Ted had just taken a
number of buttons from Jan when their
mother came softly down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Is Trouble asleep?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes. And it will soon be time for you
two Curlytops to go upstairs too,” said Mrs.
Martin, as she took up her sewing again.
“Even if it is vacation time, I can’t have my
Curlytops staying up too late.”</p>

<p>One needed to take only one look at Ted
and Janet Martin to know why they were
called “Curlytops.” It was because their
heads were covered with pretty tight little
curls of a golden color.</p>

<p>“We’ll play three more times,” said Ted.
“I’ll have all Jan’s buttons by then.”</p>

<p>“It’s my turn to win, now!” laughed his
sister.</p>

<p>They traded more buttons, first one and
then the other guessing right, and finally,
with another look at the clock, Mrs. Martin
said:</p>

<p>“Come now, Curlytops! Off to bed with
you!”</p>

<p>“Can’t we stay up until daddy comes
home?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin shook her head without looking
up.</p>

<p>“Please!” begged Jan. “You know he
said he might tell us where we were going
to stay this summer. He said so when we
were eating supper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know he did,” said Mrs. Martin.
“But daddy is late to-night. He may not be
home for an hour yet, and I can’t have you
staying up until then. You can find out in
the morning, if he knows then, where we
shall spend the summer vacation.”</p>

<p>Ted and Jan looked at one another. They
were about to make one last appeal to be
allowed to stay up, but a glance at their
mother showed them that she would not give
in to them.</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll go to a nice place this
vacation?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so,” answered Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“A place where there’s water, and where
we can go in swimming, and have a boat and
go camping and—and all that?” asked Ted
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” laughed Mrs. Martin, “I
might just as well let you stay up playing the
button game, as to let you ask me so many
questions.</p>

<p>“Now run along to bed, both of you! As
soon as daddy has made up his mind where
we’ll go for the summer vacation we’ll tell
you. Maybe you’ll hear in the morning.
But go to bed now, like good children!”</p>

<p>There was no staying up after that. But
Teddy suddenly thought of something.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother!” he cried, “may Jan and I
just go and look to see if Skyrocket is all
right? I put a new piece of carpet in his
box to-day for him to sleep on, and I want
to see if he likes it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, please! I want to see, too!”
begged Janet eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, you may take just one look at Skyrocket,”
agreed Mrs. Martin, “and then
come straight in and go to bed!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m; we will!” promised Ted. “Come
on, Jan!”</p>

<p>Skyrocket was their dog; a dear, curly,
black fellow, and all three children loved
him. While Skyrocket, I am sure, felt that
nowhere in the world were there such delightful
children as the Curlytops and little
Trouble. Skyrocket slept in a box in the
woodshed, just outside the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Out to the shed hurried Ted and Jan. It
was a little after eight o’clock, and just getting
dark.</p>

<p>“Do you think Skyrocket will like his new
carpet?” asked Jan, as Ted opened the door.</p>

<p>“I guess so. I knocked all the dust out
so he wouldn’t sneeze. Carpet dust makes
you sneeze, you know. It made me sneeze
when I was knocking it out of Skyrocket’s
carpet.”</p>

<p>Together the Curlytops opened the woodshed
door. At first they could see nothing,
because it was rather dark inside. There
was only one window, and when the children
had stood still for a moment or two they
could see this window, and also the pile of
wood and other things in the shed.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Skyrocket?” asked
Ted.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like your new carpet bed?”
asked Janet.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Of course the
Curlytops did not expect their dog to answer
in words, but whenever they spoke to him he
always either barked softly, whined or
thumped his tail on the floor. That was all
the answer they expected.</p>

<p>But this time there was neither bark,
whine nor thump of tail. All was quiet within
the woodshed.</p>

<p>“Hi, Skyrocket! Are you all right?”
asked Teddy, speaking louder.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s asleep,” suggested Jan.</p>

<p>“If he is he’d wake up when I called him,”
returned Ted. “Dogs don’t mind being
woke up. Sometimes they sleep with one eye
open anyhow. I’ll call him again. Hi, Skyrocket!”
he exclaimed. “Skyrocket, are you
all right?”</p>

<p>There was no bark, no whine, no thumping
of tail.</p>

<p>“Maybe he likes his new bed so much he
doesn’t want to wake up,” said Janet.</p>

<p>Teddy paused a moment to think this over.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” he said. “But I wish he’d come
out and see us. I’m going in to see if he’s all
right,” he added.</p>

<p>Together the Curlytops stepped within the
woodshed. They could see quite well now,
from the faint light that came in through the
window, and they looked over to where Skyrocket’s
sleeping box was, in a corner.</p>

<p>Stooping down over the box, Ted put in
his hand. He expected to feel the soft, fluffy
back of Skyrocket. But, instead, his hand
only met the carpet which the little boy had
folded and put in the box that afternoon to
make a soft bed for his pet.</p>

<p>“Is he all right?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“He—he isn’t here at all!” exclaimed Ted.</p>

<p>“He isn’t <i>here</i>! You mean <i>Skyrocket</i>
isn’t here?” cried Jan.</p>

<p>“Not in his box,” added her brother.
“You can come and feel for yourself.”</p>

<p>Janet did so. She faced Teddy in the
half-darkness of the woodshed.</p>

<p>“He—he isn’t in his bed,” she whispered.
“But maybe he’s hiding from us under the
wood. He does, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“If Skyrocket was here he’d be jumping
all over us now,” said Teddy in a strangely
quiet voice, and Janet knew her brother was
right.</p>

<p>They could not go near their pet without
having him leap all about them, and sometimes
climb half over them, in his joy at seeing
them. Now there was no Skyrocket in
the woodshed.</p>

<p>“He—he’s gone!” said Teddy, and his
voice trembled. “Skyrocket is gone, Janet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed the little girl.
“Let’s go and tell mother!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER II<br /><br />THE QUEER MAN</h2>
</div>

<p>“Mother, he’s gone!” cried Ted, as, followed
by his sister Janet, he hurried into the
house.</p>

<p>“Who is gone?” asked Mrs. Martin, who
had begun to put away her sewing, for she
had done enough that evening.</p>

<p>“Skyrocket is gone!” added Jan. “He
isn’t in the woodshed, and the window is
open.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he jumped out,” said Ted. “He
could climb up on the woodpile and jump
out the window. Do you think he’ll come
back, Mother?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin looked at her two Curlytops.</p>

<p>“Are you sure your dog Skyrocket isn’t
in the shed?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t there,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“We looked all over, and I felt in his bed,”
added Janet. “The soft carpet Ted put in
for Skyrocket is there, but our dog is gone.
Oh dear!” and she was almost crying.</p>

<p>“I’d better take a look to make sure,”
said Mrs. Martin. “We’ll bring a lamp with
us. He may be hiding in some dark corner,”
she added as she lighted a lamp.</p>

<p>“And, if he isn’t there, can we go out and
look for him?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” answered his mother. “Maybe
he’ll come back himself, if he really is
gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone,” declared Ted, sadly
enough.</p>

<p>Out to the woodshed the two Curlytops
followed their mother, who carried the lamp.
And while they are looking for the lost Skyrocket
it will be a good chance for me to let
my new readers know something of the Martin
children, as told in the previous books of
this series.</p>

<p>As I have told you, Theodore and Janet
were called the “Curlytops” as often as anything
else, and the reason for this was because
they had such curly hair. Ted’s whole
name was Theodore Baradale Martin, and
Jan’s was Janet, while “Trouble’s” right
name was William Anthony Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin kept a store in Cresco, a town
not a great way from New York, and he also
owned property in other places. Cresco was
a pretty village, and Ted and Jan thought
it one of the nicest places in the world.
Other nice places were Grandpa Martin’s
farm at Elmburg near Clover Lake, Aunt
Jo’s summer cottage at Mt. Hope on Ruby
Lake and Uncle Frank’s ranch at Rockville,
in the state of Montana.</p>

<p>The first book that tells about Janet, Ted,
and their friends, is named “The Curlytops
at Cherry Farm,” and in that I told you
what fun they had at Grandpa Martin’s
home, and how they helped sell cherries to
the Lollypop Man.</p>

<p>In the next book, “The Curlytops on Star
Island,” you may read of the fun the children
had when they went camping.</p>

<p>In the third book there is a story of “The
Curlytops Snowed In.” Many things happened
to Jan, Ted and Trouble when the
big snow storm came, and they thought they
never had had so much fun in all their lives.</p>

<p>But that was before they went out West,
and in the fourth book you have the story of
“The Curlytops at Uncle Frank’s Ranch.”
There the little folks rode ponyback and had
a grand time.</p>

<p>They came back to Cresco after many adventures,
and now it was summer again, and
there was no school, for it was the long vacation.
Ted and Janet wondered where they
would spend it, for nearly always they went
with their father and mother to some lake,
or else up in the mountains, or perhaps to the
seashore during the hot weather of July and
August.</p>

<p>I have told you, in this book, how the
Curlytops were playing the button game, and
how, just before they went to bed, they went
out to the woodshed to see if their dog Skyrocket
was all right. Besides the dog, they
had a cat named “Turnover,” who used to
roll over in a sideways somersault when told
to. The Curlytops had once had a goat
named Nicknack, but the goat had been sold
a few weeks before, so that now they had
only the cat and the dog.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t got any dog if we can’t
find Skyrocket,” said Ted, as he and Janet
went out with their mother to the shed.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll find him all right,” said Mrs.
Martin. “Perhaps he heard Turnover crying,
and he jumped out of the window to see
what the matter was with her. Skyrocket
takes good care of Turnover, you know.”</p>

<p>“But Turnover is asleep in the sitting
room,” said Ted. “She didn’t cry, so Skyrocket
didn’t jump out to help her. And
he never jumped out the window before.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s so,” agreed Mrs. Martin.
“But we’ll find him, I think, though it is
strange he isn’t in the shed where he always
sleeps at night. But wait until I look.”</p>

<p>She held the light high and low, all around
the shed, but there was no sign of the pet
dog. She called, and so did Ted and Janet,
but Skyrocket did not answer with a whine,
a bark or by a thump of his tail.</p>

<p>“Was this window closed when you put
Skyrocket in here after supper?” asked Mrs.
Martin of Teddy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I closed it,” answered the curly-headed
boy. “I always shut it ’ceptin’ on
hot nights, and it wasn’t so very hot to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the window was closed, Skyrocket
didn’t open it, that’s sure,” said Mrs.
Martin. “He’s a smart dog, and he can do
many tricks, but he can’t open the shed window.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he got out that way,
Mother?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“It looks so,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Did somebody open the window and take
Skyrocket out?” Ted wanted to know.</p>

<p>“They might have taken him out, or whistled
for him to jump out to them,” said Mrs.
Martin. “I’m sure I don’t see how else it
could have happened. Skyrocket could
jump up on the pile of wood, and from there
jump out of the window, as long as it was
open. Are you sure it was closed, Teddy
boy?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the answer. “I ’member
thinking was it hot enough to leave it open,
and then I said it wasn’t. And I made the
new piece of carpet all smooth, and Skyrocket
curled up on it, and I told him goodnight.
And then, when Janet and I came out
to look and see if he was all right—why—he
wasn’t here!” and Teddy, seven-year-old boy
though he was, acted as if he might be going
to cry.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps he just jumped out of the
window to have a little fun after dark,
though he never did it before,” said Mrs.
Martin. “We’ll take a look around the
house and call him.”</p>

<p>As they came out of the shed they heard
a voice calling them. The voice said:</p>

<p>“Hello! Where’s everybody?”</p>

<p>“It’s daddy!” exclaimed Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, Skyrocket is lost!” added Jan, as
she ran to meet her father, who stood in the
back kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Skyrocket lost? No!” exclaimed Mr.
Martin, in surprise. “Did he run away?”</p>

<p>“It looks so,” said Mrs. Martin. “Come
out here and we’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>This Janet and Teddy did, taking turns,
with Mrs. Martin putting in a word now and
then.</p>

<p>“You say you shut Skyrocket up in the
shed, and left the window closed?” said Mr.
Martin, to Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, Daddy. And when Jan and I came
out he was gone.”</p>

<p>“And he isn’t here now,” added Mrs.
Martin. “We were just going to look around
outside, and whistle and call, when we heard
your voice. You’re late, Daddy Martin!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I stayed to write some letters at the
store,” answered the merchant. “I have
been arranging about the place where we
shall go to spend the summer vacation. I
think it’s going to be at——”</p>

<p>“Hark!” suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Martin,
raising her hand to stop her husband from
speaking.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ted, while Janet
looked eagerly at her father. She wanted to
hear him say where it was they were going
that summer.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a noise back by the
little barn where we used to keep Nicknack,
the goat,” said Mrs. Martin. “Perhaps it
was Skyrocket!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed Teddy and Jan,
and, without waiting another moment, they
hurried out, running down the path toward
the little goat stable.</p>

<p>It was quite dark outside by this time, and
Ted and Janet, hurrying from the woodshed
where Mrs. Martin had a light, could not
see very well. You know how it is when you
go into a dark moving picture place from
the bright outdoors—you can’t see very well,
at first.</p>

<p>Well, this happened to Ted and Jan, and
the first Mr. and Mrs. Martin heard, after
the Curlytops ran out, was a cry from one
of them.</p>

<p>“Did you find Skyrocket?” asked Mr.
Martin, hurrying out of the shed.</p>

<p>“No, but Teddy fell down,” said Jan.</p>

<p>“Did you hurt yourself, Teddy boy?”
asked his father.</p>

<p>“N—no—I—I guess not,” answered
Teddy slowly. “I stumbled over that pile
of grass Patrick cut to-day. I fell on that—it
was nice and soft.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a good thing to pick out something
soft to fall on when you stumble,” said
Mr. Martin. “Now be careful, both of you.
Better wait for us. Mother, come and bring
the lamp. Maybe Skyrocket is shut up in the
goat stable and can’t get out.”</p>

<p>But the little stable, empty since Nicknack
had been sold, held no little dog, either. Skyrocket
was not there. And now they began
a search all around the house, whistling and
calling for the pet of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>But Skyrocket did not answer; he did not
whine, he did not bark, and there was no joyful
thump of his tail.</p>

<p>“Where can he be?” asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“Where can he be?” echoed Janet.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin looked at each other
in the light of the lamp. Then Mr. Martin
spoke.</p>

<p>“I think Skyrocket will be back by morning,”
he said. “Sometimes dogs run away,
just for the fun of it, but they usually come
back.”</p>

<p>“Skyrocket never ran away very far before,”
said Teddy. “And he always came
back when I whistled.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has gone so far he can’t hear
you this time,” said his mother. “Come,
we’ll go into the house. It’s getting late, and
you children must go to bed.”</p>

<p>“But we want Skyrocket!” cried Janet.</p>

<p>“I know, my dear. But we can’t find him,
and there is no use hunting in the dark.
We’ll leave the shed door open, and if he
comes back, as I’m sure he will, he can go in
to his new carpet bed. In the morning when
you wake up, he’ll be ready to play with
you.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do, and so Teddy
and Janet went into the house, after one last,
lingering look at the shed where Skyrocket
slept at night.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Janet. “Nothing will
ever be any fun if Skyrocket is gone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he isn’t gone, I’m sure!” said
Mr. Martin, in as jolly a voice as he could
speak. “I think he’ll be here in the morning,
though it certainly is queer about the
window being open. But now trot off to bed,
Curlytops! It’s long past your time!”</p>

<p>“Don’t feel so bad,” said Mrs. Martin. “I
don’t believe Skyrocket is lost. Haven’t you
something pleasant to tell them, Daddy?
What was that you started to say about our
summer vacation?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Mr. Martin. “I
have picked out a place for us to go. It’s a
new place. I have bought some property
there, and I expect to spend part of the summer
there looking after it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, where is it?” asked Ted, and already
he and Janet were feeling not quite so sad
over the lost dog—they had something new
to wonder over.</p>

<p>“The place where we shall spend the summer
vacation is at Silver Lake,” said Mr.
Martin. “It isn’t very far from here. We
can go by train or in an auto.”</p>

<p>“And live in a tent?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“No, I think we’ll have a bungalow,” answered
his father. “But there! I’m not going
to tell you any more about it until morning.
Off to bed with you, and dream about
Silver Lake!”</p>

<p>He kissed the Curlytops goodnight, as did
Mrs. Martin, and then Jan and Ted went upstairs.
They were smiling now, and, for the
time, had forgotten about Skyrocket, though,
of course, they wanted him to come back.</p>

<p>“Do you think their dog is really gone?”
asked Mrs. Martin of her husband, as they
sat down to talk about spending the summer
at Silver Lake.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” answered Mr. Martin.
“He never ran away before, and the window
being open makes it look as though some one
had taken him. Skyrocket is a valuable
dog, and could be taught to do tricks for a
show or circus.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Mrs. Martin. “Ted and
Janet will feel very bad at losing him.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Curlytops ran
down to the woodshed. They peered in
through the door, which was still open, and
looked in the box where Ted had so carefully
put the new piece of soft carpet to make a
bed.</p>

<p>“He—he isn’t there,” whispered the boy
softly.</p>

<p>“Skyrocket didn’t come back!” said Janet,
and there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>Slowly and sadly the Curlytops walked
out of the shed, and just as they turned to
go into the house they saw Mrs. Ransom
hurrying toward them. Mrs. Ransom was a
woman who kept a small store not far from
the Martin house, where she sold drygoods,
toys and candies.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted! Jan!” exclaimed Mrs. Ransom,
when she saw the two children, “where’s
your father?”</p>

<p>“He’s in the house eating breakfast,” answered
Jan, for she and Ted had seen him
at the table when they hurried downstairs
to look to see if Skyrocket had come back.</p>

<p>“Well, tell him to come out here, please,”
said Mrs. Ransom.</p>

<p>“Did you find Skyrocket?” asked Ted
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Skyrocket? No. I hadn’t heard that he
was lost,” answered Mrs. Ransom. “But
there’s a man acting very oddly in your front
yard, and I thought your father ought to
know about it. I saw the queer man from
my store window, and I hurried over to tell
you about him. Go in and have your father
come out. He ought to do something about
the funny man!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER III<br /><br />PUSHING AND PULLING</h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment or two Jan and Ted stood
looking at Mrs. Ransom. They knew her
very well, for she had kept her little store
near their house as long as they could remember.
They often went there to buy
candy or small toys.</p>

<p>“What’s the funny man doing?” asked
Jan, forgetting, for a little while, her sorrow
over the loss of Skyrocket.</p>

<p>“Is he funny like a clown in a circus, and
is he turning somersaults?” Ted wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Gracious goodness, no, child! Why
should he do that?” asked Mrs. Ransom.
“When I said he was funny, I meant he was
acting in a queer way. He walked toward
your house, fell down, got up again, and fell
down once more. You’d better go and tell
your father.”</p>

<p>“We will!” exclaimed Ted, starting for
the house, followed by his sister.</p>

<p>“I’d go in and tell him myself,” said Mrs.
Ransom, “but I must get back to my store.
I left it all alone to run over and tell him
about the queer man. When I saw you two
Curlytops I thought I’d tell you. Hurry in,
now!”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe he knows something about
Skyrocket!” cried Jan, with new and sudden
hope.</p>

<p>“Huh! How could he know Skyrocket?”
asked Ted. “Come on, we’ll go and see what
he’s like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t you going to tell daddy first?”
asked the little girl, as she watched Mrs. Ransom
hurry across a short-cut path through
the garden, and so back to her store.</p>

<p>“Let’s look at the man first, and see what
he does funny,” suggested Teddy. “Maybe
he’s a clown, anyhow, and maybe Mrs. Ransom
never saw one that wasn’t in a circus.
Come on!”</p>

<p>Janet hung back for a second or two, and
then followed Ted around the corner of the
house.</p>

<p>There, just as the storekeeper woman had
said, was a strange man lying on the lawn of
the Curlytops’ home. He was not doing anything
funny just then. Instead, he seemed
very still and quiet.</p>

<p>“He isn’t a bit funny!” declared Janet.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think he is,” said Teddy.
“Maybe he got tired of being funny. I’ll go
in and tell daddy.”</p>

<p>It did not take Mr. Martin long to hurry
out to the front of the house after Ted and
Jan had come in with the strange story of
the “funny man.” And Mr. Martin had no
sooner bent over the man and rolled him to
one side, to get a better look at his face, than
he cried:</p>

<p>“Why, this poor man is sick! He needs a
doctor! Ted, run in and tell mother to telephone
for Dr. Whitney. Have her ask him
to come right over here. Jan, you skip back
to the tool house and see if Patrick is there.
If he is, tell him I want him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Daddy!” exclaimed Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes, Daddy!” echoed Ted, and together
they hurried off, one into the house, the other
to get Patrick, the kindly old Irishman who
cut the grass, made the garden, and did other
work about the Martin home.</p>

<p>Janet found Patrick sharpening the lawnmower,
ready for a day’s work. Laying that
aside, he hurried to the front of the house,
where Mr. Martin was bending over the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Is he a tramp?” asked Patrick.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered Mr. Martin. “He
seems to be a poor man, but he is clean, and
few tramps are that. And though some of
his clothes are ragged, they are clean, too.
Help me carry him into the house, Patrick.
I’ve sent for Dr. Whitney.”</p>

<p>And when Dr. Whitney came he said that
the man, who had not opened his eyes since
he was carried in, was quite ill.</p>

<p>“But I think that if he has a good rest, a
little medicine, and plenty to eat he will soon
be better,” said the doctor. “Are you going
to keep him here, Mr. Martin, or shall I have
him sent to the hospital?”</p>

<p>“Oh, keep him here, Daddy!” cried Teddy.
“He looks like a good man, and maybe he
knows where our Skyrocket is.”</p>

<p>“No, I hardly think that,” answered Mr.
Martin. “But I believe I will let him stay
here, Dr. Whitney. My wife says she and
Nora will look after him, and he will be better
off than in the hospital, as long as he is not
very ill.”</p>

<p>“He is sick mostly because he hasn’t had
enough to eat,” said the doctor. “Feed him
well, and he’ll soon be all right.”</p>

<p>The doctor went away, after leaving some
medicine for the stranger. And stranger he
was, since nobody at the Martin house knew
him, and Mrs. Ransom, who came over again,
after she had found some one to stay in her
store for a little while, said she had never
seen him around Cresco before.</p>

<p>“And I know ’most everybody in Cresco,”
she added, as indeed she did, since many of
the fathers and mothers, as well as the boys
and girls, bought a good many things in her
little shop.</p>

<p>As for the “funny man” himself, he could
not tell who he was, for he seemed to be
asleep from the time Mr. Martin and Patrick
carried him in and put him to bed in a spare
room. The man was not really asleep, as
Jan and Ted learned later. It was his illness
that made him keep his eyes closed, and
would not let him talk or hear things that
were said.</p>

<p>“Now you children run out to play,” said
Mrs. Martin to Ted and Janet, after Dr.
Whitney had left. “Take Trouble with you,
and look after him. Nora and I are going
to be busy with—well, with him,” and she
nodded toward the room where the strange
man lay so quietly.</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my dear,” answered his
mother. “When he wakes up he may tell us.
Run out and play now.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go and see if we can’t find Skyrocket,”
said Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! We’ve got to find him!” added
Ted.</p>

<p>The children had hurried through their
breakfast, and now with Baby William, or
Trouble, in their care, they started to search
around the yard for the missing Skyrocket.</p>

<p>There were several buildings on the Martin
place. There was the garage, where
Daddy Martin kept his automobile, there
was the tool house, where Patrick kept the
lawn mower, the hose he used for sprinkling
the lawn, and such things. There was a hen
house and the stable where Nicknack the
goat used to live. Then, of course, there was
the woodshed, which was the home of Skyrocket.
But alas! Skyrocket was not in it
now.</p>

<p>“Let’s look there just once more!” said
Janet, as she and her two brothers walked
down the back steps toward the woodshed.
“Maybe he came back.”</p>

<p>But no Skyrocket was to be seen. There
was a bone he had been gnawing the night
before, and there was the nice, soft carpet
Teddy had given him for a bed. But the
pet dog was gone.</p>

<p>“Let’s look out in Nicknack’s stable
again,” went on Janet.</p>

<p>So they did, and in other places, but no
Skyrocket was to be found.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to put a piece in the
paper about him,” went on Jan, as she and
the two boys sat down to rest after running
about the yard, looking in all sorts of places.</p>

<p>“A piece in the paper—what do you
mean?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“I mean a—a tizerment,” declared Janet.
“You know—a piece like the one Mrs. Ransom
put in when she lost her pocketbook.
She got it back, too. Somebody found it and
brought it back. Maybe somebody has found
our Skyrocket, and they’d give him back if
they knew we wanted him. Let’s get daddy
to put a piece in the paper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we could do that,” agreed Ted, after
thinking the matter over. “We’ll tell him
when he comes home to dinner. But now
let’s look out in the auto stable again, Jan.
We didn’t look there very good. Maybe
Skyrocket is hiding in there.”</p>

<p>“Me want wide in auto!” decided Trouble,
as his brother and sister led him down the
path once more.</p>

<p>“No, dear! Daddy has the auto down at
his store,” explained Janet. “Trouble can’t
ride now.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the little fellow. “Wide to-mollow?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe you can have a ride to-morrow,”
said Ted. “And say, Jan!” he cried,
“what about Silver Lake? We almost forgot!
Maybe we’ll go there to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe we shall!” cried Janet, with
shining, eager eyes.</p>

<p>“Me go, too?” asked Trouble.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you’ll have to come, too!” sighed
Janet. “I do hope you don’t fall in too
much!” she said.</p>

<p>“Come on!” called Teddy to her. “Let’s
go and look in the garage again. We didn’t
look there very good.”</p>

<p>The garage had once been a stable, but no
horse was kept in it now, since Mr. Martin
had an automobile. There was, however, an
old carriage, and several other things, such
as a wheelbarrow, old boards, shutters,
broken doors and the like, that Patrick had
stored away.</p>

<p>“There’s lots of places for Skyrocket to
hide!” said Ted, as he and Janet entered
the garage. “Here, Sky! Sky!” he called,
and he whistled for the pet dog, giving him
the pet name of “Sky.”</p>

<p>But there was no answer. Skyrocket must
have been far away, his little owners knew,
not to answer their call. Ted and Janet forgot
Baby William for a few moments while
they searched all about the garage for their
pet dog.</p>

<p>“I guess he isn’t here,” said Janet, with
a sigh, after a while.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Teddy. “We’ll have to put
a piece in the paper. Maybe he——”</p>

<p>Teddy suddenly stopped speaking, for
both he and Janet heard a funny little squeal.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“That’s Skyrocket!” added Jan, clapping
her hands. “He’s caught fast somewhere
and can’t get out.”</p>

<p>They both stood still, listening for the cry
to sound once more. It did, but in a different
way. For besides the squeal came a call
of:</p>

<p>“Ted! Jan! Oh! Oh! I tan’t det out! I
caught fast! Oh, tum an’ det me!”</p>

<p>“It’s Trouble!” shouted Janet.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” cried Ted.</p>

<p>They looked around. They had let go of
the hands of their little brother while searching
in the back part of the garage among the
odds and ends for Skyrocket. They had forgotten
about Baby William for a time, and
now they could not see where he was.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Trouble? Where are
you?” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“I—I’se stuck!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear! But where are you?” asked
Janet.</p>

<p>“In de horsie wagon!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s playing in the old carriage!”
exclaimed Ted, for Trouble always called
that the “horsie wagon.”</p>

<p>It did not take Jan and her older brother
long to reach the place where Trouble was.
But instead of seeing him upon the seat of
the battered old carriage, where he sometimes
climbed to play he was driving a horse,
they saw him caught in between the spokes
of one of the wheels.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” cried Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” shouted Teddy.</p>

<p>And well might they say this, for Trouble
was indeed in trouble. His head was stuck
between two spokes, and he could not get it
out either way.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he cried to his brother and
sister. “Help me det out!”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll help you, dear!” said
Janet. “But how did you get caught that
way?”</p>

<p>“I was playin’ peek-a-boo wif a chicken.”</p>

<p>“Peek-a-boo with a chicken?” echoed Ted.</p>

<p>“Yeppie! He chicken, he comed in de
auto house, an’ he looked at me froo de
horsie wagon wheel, an’ I looked at him, an’
I did stick my head froo de spokes, I did,
an’ I did holler ‘peek-a-boo!’ an’ den I
touldn’t det out!”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say you couldn’t!” cried
Janet. “Take hold of him, Teddy, and push
him out.”</p>

<p>“We can’t push him out, we’ve got to pull
him!” decided Teddy; after looking at the
way his baby brother was caught.</p>

<p>“No, he’s got to be pushed!” insisted
Janet.</p>

<p>“Pulled!” cried Teddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, det me out! Det me out!” wailed
Trouble.</p>

<p>Janet took hold of his legs, and Teddy
took hold of his head. But as Janet pushed
and Teddy pushed also, instead of pulling,
which he had said was the right way, poor
Baby William stayed just where he was,
with his head caught between two carriage
spokes.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, we’ll never get him out!” said
Janet. “What’ll we do, Ted?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to try again,” decided Ted.
“We’ll both push, and then we’ll both pull.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Janet.</p>

<p>Whether it was that Ted and Jan pushed
or pulled at the wrong time, or whether it
was that they were so excited they didn’t
know what they were doing, I can’t say, but
Trouble was still held fast, and with tears in
his eyes he looked up from his queer position
and cried:</p>

<p>“Det me out! Det me out!”</p>

</div>

<p>Trouble was now crying and kicking with
his little heels against the floor of the
garage. Part of his little body was half way
under the carriage, the front wheels of which
were turned in such a way that Janet could
reach her little brother’s legs. His head
stuck out through one of the front wheels,
in between two spokes.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get him out!” decided
Janet, as she and Ted paused to get their
breath.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Teddy. “Let’s both pull
hard!”</p>

<p>They were about to take hold of Baby
William once more, but he screamed so
loudly that they held back.</p>

<p>“You hurted me!” he wailed. “You
hurted me! Don’t push me an’ pull me any
more!”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to get you out, Trouble!”
said Teddy. “We have to push you or pull
you!”</p>

<p>“Which hurts the most, Trouble?” asked
Jan kindly. “Does it hurt most to pull you
or to push you?”</p>

<p>“Dey boff hurts!” sobbed the little boy.
“You go and tell my mommer I wants her
to get me out! I wants my mommer!”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better do that!” decided
Teddy. “You go for mother, Jan. I’ll stay
with Trouble.”</p>

<p>Off toward the house hurried the little
girl. She burst into the kitchen, where Mrs.
Martin was making some broth for the sick
man who had fallen down through weakness
and hunger on the Martin lawn that
morning.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, he’s stuck fast!” cried
Janet.</p>

<p>“Who, Skyrocket? Did you find him?”
asked Mrs. Martin, thinking of course it was
the dog about which her little daughter was
talking.</p>

<p>“No, Skyrocket isn’t stuck fast. We
didn’t find him,” replied Janet. “It’s
Trouble! He’s stuck fast! And Teddy
pulled and I pulled, and then we both
pushed, but we can’t get him loose. He’s
stuck!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” sighed Mrs. Martin.
“What will happen next? Here, Nora,
watch this broth so it doesn’t burn. Now,
Jan, come and show me where Trouble is
stuck fast.”</p>

<p>Taking hold of Janet’s hand, Mrs. Martin
hurried out to the garage. Rushing in,
she saw Teddy holding Trouble’s head, which
was still thrust between two of the carriage
wheel spokes.</p>

<p>“Is he badly hurt?” asked Mrs. Martin,
thinking perhaps Baby William was in
worse trouble than Janet had told her.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he isn’t hurt,” explained Ted.
“He just can’t get his head out, that’s all.
I’m holding it up for him, ’cause he says the
wheel spokes hurt his neck.”</p>

<p>“Poor little darling! I should think they
would!” said his mother.</p>

<p>“I—I was playin’ peek-a-boo wif a chicken,”
explained Baby William. “An’ I stuck
in my head, but I can’t stick it out! Oh,
Muzzie!” he cried, using a pet name for his
mother that he had almost forgotten, “you
det me out!”</p>

<p>“Of course I will!” exclaimed Mrs.
Martin. “Here, Ted, let me get hold of him.”</p>

<p>“You can’t push him out!” declared Ted.</p>

<p>“And you can’t pull him out,” added
Janet. “His head is too big!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin gave one look at the wheel
spokes, she saw just how Trouble’s head was
caught, and then, with a quick motion, she
lifted him up, pulled him back, and in another
moment he was safe in her arms and
sobbing on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why—why!” exclaimed Teddy, “how’d
you do it so quick, Mother?”</p>

<p>“We tried and tried, an’ we couldn’t do
it,” added Jan. “We pushed and we pulled;
didn’t we, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, you should have lifted up,” said
Mrs. Martin with a smile.</p>

<p>“We never thought of that,” Teddy said.</p>

<p>“You see the carriage wheel spokes are
put together like the letter ‘V,’” said Mrs.
Martin, as she showed the two older children.
“When Trouble’s head and neck
were toward the bottom of the V they were
in so tightly that neither pushing nor pulling
would get him out. But when I lifted
him up I raised him toward the wide part
of the V, at the place where he had stuck
his head in, and then it was easy enough to
get him out. But you mustn’t do it again,
Baby William!” she added, as she patted
the sobbing little fellow on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“No, me don’t want to play peek-a-boo
wif a chicken any more at all!” decided
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you found your dog yet?” their
mother asked.</p>

<p>Ted and Jan sadly shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he’ll come home,” said Mrs.
Martin kindly. “He may be off paying a
visit to some doggie friends of his. Look
around some more, and take good care of
Trouble.”</p>

<p>Baby William felt better now, especially
after Nora had brought out to him, and also
to Janet and Teddy, some sugar cookies.
Munching these, the children wandered
around, looking here, there, everywhere for
the lost Skyrocket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin went back to the kitchen to
finish making the broth for the sick man.</p>

<p>“I wish he would wake up,” said Teddy,
as he and his sister, each holding a hand of
Baby William, walked about searching for
the pet dog. They had looked in the room
of the sick man.</p>

<p>“What do you want him to wake up for?
To tell us a story?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe he can tell stories!” exclaimed
Ted. “I didn’t think of that. But I want
to ask him if he saw Skyrocket. He’s a
tramp, and tramps see lots of dogs when
they walk around.”</p>

<p>“He is not a tramp!” declared Jan. “I
heard daddy say he wasn’t a tramp, even if
he was poor.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’d been walkin’ a lot!” exclaimed
Ted. “I looked at his shoes when daddy and
Patrick carried him into the house, and his
shoes had a lot of holes in ’em. Shoes get
holes in ’em when you walk a lot, and if
you walk a lot you’re a tramp, even if you
have good clothes. So maybe he did see Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he did,” agreed Janet,
thinking that, as Teddy was older than she,
he must know more about it.</p>

<p>“’Et’s go in an’ p’ay buttons!” suddenly
proposed Trouble, as he thought of the fun
he had had the night before. “I want all de
wed buttons!”</p>

<p>“No, dear, we aren’t going to play the button
game now,” said Janet. “We must look
for Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Trouble want to play buttons!” exclaimed
the little fellow. “If no play,
Trouble sit down in de mud!” and he pulled
his hands away from both Ted and Janet
and started toward a little mud puddle at
one side of the garden path.</p>

<p>Jan looked at Ted, not knowing what to
do.</p>

<p>“No play button game, Trouble sit in de
mud!” cried the little fellow; and, tiny
“tyke” that he was, he stuck the toe of one
shoe in the puddle.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jan will play the button game!”
cried his sister. “Don’t sit in the mud!”
She ran over and caught Trouble by the hand
again. “I’ll take him up to the house and
get out the button bag,” said Jan to Ted.
“You can keep on looking for Skyrocket.
Mother won’t like it if Trouble gets all
muddy, and he will sit down in it if I don’t
keep hold of him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Ted. “You can play
with him. I’ll go and see if I can find Skyrocket.
But if that man wakes up you come
and tell me. I want to ask him if he saw
our dog.”</p>

<p>A little later, when Janet had taken
Trouble back to the house, and while Ted
was walking down in the peach orchard,
whistling and calling to Skyrocket, the boy
heard an answering signal.</p>

<p>“Hello!” called Ted. “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“It’s me,” was the answer, which, if not
just the right way to answer, told Teddy
what he wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello, Tom!” he called, as Tom Taylor,
a boy chum who lived in the next street,
came walking along the orchard path.
“What are you doin’?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’!” answered Tom. “What you
doin’, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Looking for our dog,” said Teddy, beginning
to remember that his mother had
told him to be careful not to drop the last
letter “G” from his words that needed it.
“Skyrocket is lost.”</p>

<p>“Skyrocket lost?” cried Tom Taylor.
“How’d it happen?”</p>

<p>Teddy told the simple little story, and also
how he and Janet had been looking for their
missing pet, and how Trouble had been
caught in the carriage wheel.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you look,” offered Tom. “Skyrocket
is a nice dog. Maybe some tramp
opened the woodshed window and coaxed
him out,” he added.</p>

<p>“There’s a tramp up at our house now,”
said Ted, rather proud to be able to tell such
news as that.</p>

<p>“A tramp! There is?” cried Tom. “Did
he take Skyrocket?”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t zactly a tramp,” went on
Ted, and then he explained about the man
his father and Patrick had carried in.
“When he gets woke up I’m going to ask
him about Skyrocket, though.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better,” agreed Tom.
“Now come on, I’ll help you look.”</p>

<p>But, though the two little boys wandered
here and there, calling and whistling, there
was no sign of Skyrocket.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to put a piece in the
paper about him,” decided Ted, as he sat
down to rest on the bank of a little pond in
the shade of a willow tree.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll find him,” said Tom, again.
“Say, I know what we can do while we’re
resting,” he went on.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We can make a raft and go riding in the
pond,” answered Tom. “It’s got lots of
water in now, after the rain. We can make
a raft from the fence boards and have a
dandy sail.”</p>

<p>Ted thought about it for a moment, and
then said:</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll do! We can take off
our shoes and stockings, ’cause a raft isn’t
like a boat. The water sloshes all up on it.
We’ll go barefoot, and we’ll have a lot of
fun.”</p>

<p>The pond where the boys had sat down to
rest in the shade was not usually deep
enough to float a raft, or any boat except
tiny toy ones. But since the rain two days
before had made the pond larger and deeper,
and also muddier, there was, as Tom had
said, water enough to let a small raft of
boards be paddled around in it.</p>

<p>This raft Ted and Tom now started to
make. There were plenty of loose fence
boards near the pond, and some of the boards
had nails in them. Using stones for hammers,
the two boys knocked out some of the
rusty nails, and drove them in again, fastening
a number of boards together. Then they
put the raft in the water. It floated, but
when Tom and Ted stood on it, the raft sank
out of sight under the muddy surface.</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t touch bottom!” cried Ted,
as he pushed it about with a willow pole.
“It floats, and we don’t care if we get our
feet wet, ’cause we’ve got our shoes and
stockings off.”</p>

<p>“Hi! We’ll have lots of fun!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>And the boys did. They pushed the raft
to and fro, from one side of the little meadow
pond to the other. They pretended they
were making long voyages, and half the time
Ted was captain of the “ship,” and the other
half it was Tom’s turn.</p>

<p>The boys were having a very jolly time,
thinking nothing of splashing each other
with the muddy water as they poled the raft
about, when suddenly Ted gave too hard a
thrust on his pole. It broke in two pieces
and the next second he found himself splashing
about in the muddy water. He had fallen
off the raft!</p>

<p>“Oh! Wug! Guggle! Blug!” spluttered
Ted, his mouth full of muddy water.</p>

<p>“Wait! Sit still! I’ll get you out!” cried
Tom.</p>

<p>But Ted did not wait. The water was not
deep—hardly up to his knees, and, after
splashing and floundering about, he managed
to stand up on his feet. He did not “sit
still” as Tom had told him to.</p>

<p>Oh, but he was a sight—all muddy, and
dripping water all over!</p>

<p>“Are—are you hurt?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“N—n-no!” stammered Ted, in answer.
“You don’t need to jump in to get me out.
I—I can wade out.”</p>

<p>“Get on the raft and I’ll pole you to
shore,” offered Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can do that,” Ted answered.
“There might be glass on the bottom and
I’d cut my feet. I’ll get on.”</p>

<p>He managed to get aboard the raft again,
though he nearly tipped Tom off in doing
so. Then the two boys poled their craft to
shore.</p>

<p>“Say, you are wet!” exclaimed Tom, as he
looked at his chum. “Awful wet! Will
your mother be mad?”</p>

<p>“I guess she won’t like it,” Ted confessed.
“But if I stay out long enough maybe I’ll
dry. I guess we won’t sail any more.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Tom, “I guess we better
not. I’ll walk around with you till you get
dry.”</p>

<p>It was a warm, sunny day, and Ted felt
sure he would not take cold from his ducking.
He knew, too, that the sun and wind
would soon dry his clothes, though of course
the mud would still remain.</p>

<p>So he and Tom walked about in the lower
peach orchard, and around in the meadow
where the pond was, on which they had
sailed the raft. Ted was about half dry,
and the two boys were throwing stones in
the water, seeing who could make the biggest
splash, when they saw Mrs. Ransom,
owner of the little store, hurrying along the
meadow path.</p>

<p>“Hello, boys!” she called pleasantly to
Ted and Tom. She knew them well, for
they spent many pennies over her counter.</p>

<p>“Hello, Miss Ransom!” answered the two
boys.</p>

<p>“Land sakes! what are you all wet and
muddy for, Teddy Martin?” asked the
storekeeper, when she saw the state Teddy
was in. “It hasn’t been raining, has it?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” answered Ted. “I fell off the
raft.”</p>

<p>“Raft? What raft?” asked Mrs. Ransom.
“I didn’t know there was a raft
around here.”</p>

<p>“Ted and I made one,” explained Tom,
“an’ his pole broke and he fell in. He’s
walkin’ around to dry himself off.”</p>

<p>“Land sakes!” exclaimed Mrs. Ransom.
“Your mother won’t like that, Teddy Martin.
But I mustn’t stand here talking.
I’m going over to Constable Juke’s house.
Have you see him this morning?”</p>

<p>“Constable Juke!” exclaimed Teddy and
Tom in one breath.</p>

<p>“Yes, I want him to arrest somebody,”
went on Mrs. Ransom.</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other. A constable
in the country, they knew, was the
same as a policeman in the city. He could
arrest people if they were bad.</p>

<p>“You—you want Constable Juke?” asked
Ted, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“To arrest somebody?” asked Tom, almost
whispering.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I want him to do if he
can catch ’em!”</p>

<p>“Is it—do you want him to arrest <i>us</i>,
’cause I fell in the water, Miss Ransom?”
asked Teddy, and his voice trembled.</p>

<p>“Land sakes, no, child!” laughed the storekeeper
lady. “What ever put such a notion
in your head? What I want of Constable
Juke is to have him arrest somebody that
robbed my store.”</p>

<p>“Robbed your store!” cried Ted and Tom.
This was getting more and more exciting.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on Mrs. Ransom, whom the
boys were apt to call “Miss,” though she
had been married and was a widow. “Some
one got into my place last night and took a
lot of things. I didn’t miss ’em until just
now. And as soon as I did I started for the
constable. I’m on my way there now. I
hope to find him at home.”</p>

<p>“Did they take any money?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, a little. But they took some other
things, too. I don’t mind the money so
much, nor the other things. But they took
a queer box my brother, that used to be a
sailor, brought me from a far-off country.
It was a very queer box, and I wouldn’t sell
it for a lot of money. Now the burglars have
it, and I’m going to have them arrested if
Constable Juke can find ’em! Land sakes,
but I must hurry on! Stay out in the sun,
Teddy, until you get dry, and then most of
that mud will brush off. Dear me! To think
that queer box should be taken after all these
years that I’ve kept it! I hope I can get it
back!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER V<br /><br />UNCLE BEN</h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Ransom hurried along the meadow
path on her way to the house of Constable
Juke. The constable was not like a regular
policeman. He did not wear a blue uniform
with brass buttons, and he did not walk up
and down the street swinging a club. He
was just a farmer, and when he was called
on to arrest anybody, as he was once in a
while in Cresco, he just went out in his regular
working clothes and took the person to
the jail.</p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed Tom, as he watched
Mrs. Ransom hurrying away, “I’d better go
home, I guess, Ted, and so had you.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Ted. “Let’s go and
see Constable Juke arrest the burglars that
robbed Miss Ransom’s store.”</p>

<p>“Nope! I’m going home!” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“But what for?” asked Ted again.</p>

<p>“’Cause,” explained his playmate, “if
burglars robbed Miss Ransom’s store maybe
they robbed our house, and maybe my mother
would want me to help catch ’em—or, anyhow,
go after the constable for her. And
maybe they robbed your house, too, Teddy.
You’d better go home.”</p>

<p>Ted looked down at his clothes, which were
only partly dry and which still had much
mud on them.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t b’lieve I’ll go home yet,” he
said. “I’ll stay out in the sun till I get
dryer. Anyhow, our house wasn’t robbed.
I was there all night, and no burglars came
in. We have a tramp at our house,” he
added. “You know—the one I told you
about.”</p>

<p>Tom thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“Say!” he cried, “maybe he’s the man
that took the things from Miss Ransom’s
store. Tramps rob places, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Ted. “But I don’t believe
this tramp did. He’s a nice looking
man. Anyhow, Miss Ransom saw him on
our lawn, and he wasn’t in her store. I guess
it was somebody else.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was, too,” agreed Tom. “Anyhow,
I’m going home to see if we had any
robbers. If we had, I’ll tell you about it,
and then we can go off in the woods and
hunt for ’em!”</p>

<p>Both boys looked across the meadow to
the house of Constable Juke. They could
see, even from where they stood, Mrs. Ransom
going into the yard, and after they had
watched a little longer, they saw a man come
out and speak to the woman who kept the
candy and notion store.</p>

<p>“That’s Constable Juke now,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“And she’s telling him all about the robbers,”
added Ted.</p>

<p>“I’m going to hurry home,” went on Tom.
“And if there’ve been any robbers at our
house I’ll go and tell the constable, too.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked his chum.</p>

<p>“’Cause we want to catch ’em ourselves.
If you find out your house has been robbed,
you come and tell me and we’ll hunt the
burglars. We won’t say anything about it
to Constable Juke till we catch the burglars.”</p>

<p>“Say, that’ll be fun!” cried Tom, his eyes
opening wide. “Won’t everybody be
s’prised?”</p>

<p>“They surely will,” cried Ted. “You
hurry back now, and then come an’ tell me.”</p>

<p>Tom ran off across the meadow, and Ted
walked slowly up and down in the sun, waiting
for the mud to dry, so it could be brushed
off. But, after a while, he grew tired of this.</p>

<p>“I guess it doesn’t show much now,” he
said to himself as he tried to turn around to
look at his back. “Anyhow, I’m going to tell
mother I fell in. Besides, she can see I did.
I might as well go home now and see if we
had any burglars. I don’t see how we could,
but maybe we did,” he added, half wishing
this would be so. “Then Tom and I could
catch ’em all together.”</p>

<p>So, not waiting for Tom to come back,
Ted hurried home. Out in front of the
house he saw an automobile, which he knew
was not his father’s.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe there’s a policeman in there
now about the burglars!” thought the little
boy. But, as he entered the house, he heard
the voice of Dr. Whitney. It was the
doctor’s automobile out in front.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think he will do very nicely now,”
Ted heard the doctor saying.</p>

<p>The doctor and Ted’s mother came out of
the room where the sick man had been put
to bed.</p>

<p>“Hello there, Curlytop!” cried Dr. Whitney
to Ted, as he ruffled up the tangled curls
of the little fellow. “Well, where have you
been, in swimming?” the doctor asked with
a laugh, as he noticed the mud on the boy
and the wet clothes.</p>

<p>“I—I wasn’t swimming,” said Teddy.
“I fell in—off the raft.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Theodore Martin!” cried his
mother. “What do you mean? What raft?”</p>

<p>Of course Teddy had to tell all about it
then, but he hurried over the accident in the
water as fast as he could, for he had other
news.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” he exclaimed, before
his mother could say anything about
his having fallen off the raft. “Miss Ransom’s
store was robbed and she’s gone after
Constable Juke, and maybe Tom Taylor’s
house is robbed, too, and the burglars took
a queer box from Miss Ransom that her
brother brought from away off and Tom
and me—I mean Tom and I are going
to——”</p>

<p>Teddy stopped just then. There were a
number of reasons for this. One was that
he was out of breath, from having talked so
fast.</p>

<p>Another was that he thought, just in time,
that he had better not say he and Tom were
going to try to find the burglars—for that is
what Ted had on the tip of his tongue to say
next. Another reason for stopping so
quickly was that his mother held up her
hand, just as a policeman at a busy street
crossing holds up his hand to stop the automobiles.
Whenever Mrs. Martin did that,
Teddy knew he must calm down. And he
did this time.</p>

<p>“Theodore Baradale Martin!” said his
mother slowly, “what does all this talk mean
about burglars?”</p>

<p>“It’s true, Mother!” exclaimed Teddy.
“Miss Ransom’s store was robbed, and the
burglars took some money and a queer box
and—and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s true,” said Dr. Whitney, nodding
his head as Mrs. Martin looked at him.
“I heard something about it as I was coming
here just now, but I didn’t pay much attention.
I didn’t hear anything about Tom
Taylor’s house being robbed, though, Teddy.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe Tom’s isn’t,” answered the
Curlytop lad. “He’s gone home to find out
about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Martin with a smile.
“Well, there haven’t been any burglars here,
I’m glad to say. Now, Teddy, you go and
get washed and put on clean clothes. Then
you go out and help Jan take care of Baby
William.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Teddy. But he made up
his mind that as soon as he could he would
see Tom and find out if any burglars had
been at his friend’s house.</p>

<p>That afternoon nearly everybody in Cresco
knew about Mrs. Ransom’s store having
been robbed. But that was the only place in
the town that had been entered. Much to
the disappointment of Ted and Tom, no
burglars had been at the Taylor house. And
the story of the robbery at Mrs. Ransom’s
was very simple. As a matter of fact no one
knew anything about it.</p>

<p>The woman who kept the store counted
up the money in the drawer and she found
that some had been taken. Then she looked
around her house and shop and found that
some silver spoons were gone, and also some
things from the store.</p>

<p>“But what I miss most of all,” she said to
Mrs. Martin, when she came over to talk
about her loss, “is a queer box my brother,
who used to be a sailor, brought me from a
far-off land. The box was made in Japan,
and if you didn’t know how to open it you
could try all night and never get the cover
off or the little drawer out.”</p>

<p>“Was anything in the box?” asked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes, there was a picture of my brother
and some other things I wanted very much
to keep to remember my brother by.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” asked Teddy softly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid he is by this time,” said
Mrs. Ransom. “You see, my brother is a
sailor. He went off on a voyage a good many
years ago, and I haven’t heard from him
since. I guess he was shipwrecked. He gave
me that box just before he went away for the
last time, and his picture was in it. That’s
why I thought so much of it, and why I feel
so sorry that the burglars took it. They
could have my spoons, the money and everything
else, if they’d give me back the queer
box with the puzzle top. Nobody knows
how to open it, except the man who made it,
my brother John and myself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ransom could not tell how the burglars
got in. There was no sign of a door or
a window being broken, and Constable Juke,
who came over to look at the store, said he
guessed the robbers (or robber, if there was
only one) must have sneaked in when Mrs.
Ransom was out for a little while, and so
have taken the things.</p>

<p>“But I’ll keep my eyes open for the robber,”
he promised, “and if I see him around
I’ll arrest him and get back your spoons,
Mrs. Ransom.”</p>

<p>“Get back Brother John’s queer box,”
begged the storekeeper. “I want that more
than anything else.”</p>

<p>She went back to her little shop, the constable
went home, and Ted, Janet, and
Baby William sat down to supper.</p>

<p>“How is the sick man?” asked Daddy
Martin, when he came home.</p>

<p>“Much better,” answered Mother Martin.
“Dr. Whitney says he’ll soon be sitting up.”</p>

<p>“May we go in and see him?” asked
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” answered their mother.</p>

<p>Two days later Ted, Jan, and Baby William
were allowed to go into the room where
the “tramp,” as the children often called
him, was sitting up in an easy chair. He
looked much better than when he had been
carried in a few days before.</p>

<p>Ted and Jan stared at the invalid, who
was fast getting better. And Ted suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, he’s Uncle Ben!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Ben!” repeated his father. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, he looks just like the picture of
Uncle Ben in our photograph album,” went
on Teddy. “Doesn’t he, Mother?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin looked closely at the man, who
had a bushy, brown beard.</p>

<p>“I have been puzzling my head, trying to
think whom you did look like,” she said to
the stranger. “Now I know. It is Uncle
Ben!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />OFF TO SILVER LAKE</h2>
</div>

<p>The sick man smiled at the children and
at Mr. and Mrs. Martin. When he smiled
he had a very pleasant face—in fact, he had
a very pleasant face at all times, now that he
was getting well and strong.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know I look like some one in
this family, which has been so kind to me,”
he said. “But I’m sorry to say I’m not your
Uncle Ben, my dear little Curlytop!”</p>

<p>Ted was surprised to hear the man use the
pet name, but then that was not strange, as
many persons, seeing Ted and Jan for the
first time, called them “Curlytops,” for that
name seemed just to fit them.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you anybody’s Uncle Ben?”
asked Janet softly. “You look exactly as if
you ought to be somebody’s Uncle Ben.”</p>

<p>The man, sitting up in the easy chair
laughed, and his laugh was a pleasant one
and caused the children to like him more than
ever.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I suppose I am some
one’s Uncle Ben. My name, which I have
not had a chance to tell you,” he went on,
“is Benjamin Wilson,” and he looked at
Mr. and Mrs. Martin. “Some years ago my
sister, who lived in New York, had two children,
and of course I was Uncle Ben to them.
But they both died, and now I am not Uncle
Ben to any one.”</p>

<p>Just then Baby William, who was always
an impulsive little chap, broke away from
Jan, who was holding him, and ran to the
strange man—no, I must not call him a
stranger any longer. I must use his name—Mr.
Wilson. Trouble climbed up into the
lap of Mr. Wilson, and clasped his baby
fingers in the man’s brown beard.</p>

<p>“I ’ikes you!” he lisped.</p>

<p>“Do you? Well, I’m glad of that. And
I like you!” laughed Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>“Say!” cried Teddy, struck with a new
thought, “couldn’t you be our Uncle Ben?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson looked at Mr. and Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, the children could call
you that,” said the mother of the Curlytops.
“The Uncle Ben they speak of, whose picture
is in our photograph album, is my uncle,
but they always claim him as their own. He
does look a great deal like you. His name is
Benjamin Thompson, and he lives in Florida.
We don’t see him very often, but the
children like to look at his picture.”</p>

<p>“He looks just like you,” declared Jan.
“Can’t we call you Uncle Ben?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson did not answer for a moment.
Then, looking at Mr. and Mrs. Martin, he
said:</p>

<p>“You have been so kind to me that I must
tell you my story. After that, if the children
want to, they may call me Uncle Ben.
But it will be only for a little while, as I hope
soon to be able to travel on.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson’s story was quite a long one,
and I will not put it all down here. Enough
to say that he had worked as a sailor for a
number of years, until he lost his health.
Then he had to get something else to do. But
he did not get better, his relatives all died
or he lost track of them, and at last he could
not work hard enough, any longer, to make a
good living.</p>

<p>“So I turned into what is often called a
tramp,” he said. “I went from place to
place, trying to get a little work here and
there. A doctor told me that if I could live
out of doors for six months I would get well
and strong again. But the only kind of life
out of doors is that on a farm or being a
sailor, and I am not strong enough to plow
and do farm work, and cannot get on a ship.
So I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>“I wandered to Cresco, thinking perhaps
I might get work here. I didn’t have very
much to eat, and when I reached your house
I was weak and I just couldn’t go any further.
Everything seemed to be going around
and around, and I—I fell down, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did,” said Teddy, who, like
Jan, was eagerly listening to this story.
“You fell down, and Miss Ransom told us
you were acting funny, and we told mother,
and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you brought me in and have
been very kind to me ever since,” said Mr.
Wilson. “But I cannot stay here. I must
travel on and see if I can’t get work out of
doors. Then I could get well and strong
again.”</p>

<p>“And now may we call you Uncle Ben?”
asked Jan, when the man had brought his
story to a close.</p>

<p>“Of course you may, children!” exclaimed
their mother. “If he was Uncle Ben once
he is Uncle Ben still, and though he isn’t the
same Uncle Ben you know down in Florida,
I think it will be nice to call him that, since
it really is his name.”</p>

<p>“Were you a sailor long, Uncle Ben?”
asked Ted, now that this point was settled.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was a sailor for several years,”
was the answer. “I sailed to many queer
places, and once I was shipwrecked. Then
I was taken ill and found a sailor’s life too
hard for me. I liked it, though, for I like
to be near the water and around boats. All
sailors do.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ransom’s brother was a sailor,”
said Janet. “And he went off on a ship and
maybe he was shipwrecked, and she didn’t
ever see him again, and he left her a funny
box that nobody except two or three could
open, but the burglars took the box and did
you see them, I mean the burglars, Uncle
Ben?” she asked, all out of breath.</p>

<p>“My, that’s a lot of talk for a little girl!”
exclaimed Mr. Wilson, with a laugh. “And
who is this Mrs. Ransom at whose house the
burglars called?”</p>

<p>By turns they explained to him what had
happened and how the little store had been
robbed.</p>

<p>“It happened the same day you came to
our house, Uncle Ben,” said Teddy. “And
Tom Taylor and I were thinking maybe we
could catch the robbers if Constable Juke
didn’t. So—maybe—did you see any of ’em
as you came along—tramping on the road,
you know?”</p>

<p>Uncle Ben shook his head.</p>

<p>“If I saw the robbers I didn’t know
them,” he answered. “I was too weak and
sick to notice anything. All I wanted was
to get to a place where I could lie down and
rest, and then have something to eat, perhaps.
And I found such a place, thanks to
you,” he added with a grateful look at Mr.
and Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, now, children, you have heard and
talked enough, I think,” said Mrs. Martin
to Ted and Jan, who were crowded as close
as they could get to their new friend. “Come,
Trouble!” and she held out her hands.</p>

<p>“Trouble! Is that his name?” asked Mr.
Wilson.</p>

<p>“It’s his pet name,” answered Mr. Martin.
“Though he does get into trouble now
and then. But we must let you rest. Please
stay here as long as you like, and you must
not go until we have had another talk. I
may be able to find out-of-doors work for
you that will not be as hard as farming or as
work on shipboard.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could!” said Uncle Ben eagerly.
“I want to work. I don’t like being a
tramp. And I want to be a real Uncle Ben
to these Curlytops!” and he smiled at Ted
and Jan.</p>

<p>“I ’ikes you!” said Trouble again. “You
be my Unk Ben, too?”</p>

<p>“If you want me to, I will,” was the smiling
answer.</p>

<p>“Yes—me wants!” said Trouble, as if that
settled it. And not until then did he slip
down out of the comfortable lap.</p>

<p>“It’s nice to have an Uncle Ben, isn’t it?”
asked Ted of Janet after they had left the
room.</p>

<p>“Awful nice,” she replied. “I hope he’ll
stay with us forever.”</p>

<p>“And I hope Tom and I can catch the
burglars and get back Miss Ransom’s queer
box,” said Teddy. “Maybe she’ll give us a
reward.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather get back Skyrocket than the
box,” said Janet. “But course I want Miss
Ransom to get her box too. But I want
Skyrocket most of all!”</p>

<p>“Oh, so do I!” exclaimed her brother.
“Oh, Jan!” he cried. “I just thought of it!
Maybe the burglars took our dog!”</p>

<p>“Maybe they did!” agreed Jan.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell Constable Juke!” decided
Ted.</p>

<p>But just then his mother called to ask him
to bring in some chips to boil the teakettle,
and it was not until some time later that the
little boy had a chance to go to the constable
about the lost dog. For Skyrocket continued
to be lost. Though Ted and Janet hunted all
over town for him, and their boy and girl
friends did the same, Skyrocket was not to
be found, nor did he come back to his sleeping
box in the woodshed.</p>

<p>Though Ted and Janet felt very bad about
their loss, so many other things happened
at the same time that they did not grieve as
otherwise they might have done. They had
something else to think about.</p>

<p>“Mother, has daddy said any more about
where we are going for our vacation?” asked
Janet one day.</p>

<p>“Yes; what about Silver Lake?” inquired
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we haven’t forgotten about vacation—or
Silver Lake, either,” said Mrs. Martin
with a smile. “I think daddy will have
something to tell you this evening. Now,
Jan, will you run over to Mrs. Kent’s, and
ask her if she can let me have the spool of
strong, black thread. I want to mend some
of Uncle Ben’s clothes. Mrs. Ransom was
out of it and Mrs. Kent said she had some
she would let me have.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” exclaimed Jan. “Will Uncle
Ben come out and play with us to-day?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps to-morrow,” her mother
answered. “Dr. Whitney said he must not
go too fast all at once. He may take a walk
with you to-morrow or next day.”</p>

<p>“Goody!” cried Janet.</p>

<p>“That’ll be fun!” exclaimed Ted.</p>

<p>The more the Curlytops saw of Uncle Ben
the more they liked him. And Mr. and Mrs.
Martin, too, were growing fond of the
stranger who had fallen almost at their very
door. He proved to be a good man, and Mr.
Martin was sure he was one who could be
trusted. He was slowly getting better, and
could walk around the house now and go
out into the yard and sit in the shade. But
he had not been able, yet, to play with Ted
and Jan, who wanted some one pretty lively
to enter into their games.</p>

<p>“You look after Trouble while Janet goes
for the thread for me,” said Mrs. Martin to
Teddy.</p>

<p>“All right, Mother,” was the answer.
“Come on, Trouble. We’ll go down to the
brook and I’ll show you my water wheel.
It splashes around like anything!”</p>

<p>Janet soon reached Mrs. Kent’s house and
told what was wanted. Mrs. Kent was busy
churning. Into a blue tub, shaped like a
barrel, she had poured some sour cream. Inside
the barrel was a round piece of wood,
called a “dasher,” and fastened to this was
a long stick, like a broom handle. Mrs. Kent
made the handle go up and down, and this
splashed the dasher in the sour cream, and
churned it into butter.</p>

<p>She had just taken off the cover, to look
in to see how near the butter was to “coming”
when Jan arrived.</p>

<p>“Sit down here, my dear, while I get the
thread for you,” said Mrs. Kent. “I won’t
be but a moment.”</p>

<p>Janet sat down. Then she thought she
would look down in the churn, to see if there
were any little round balls of yellow butter
yet. Her mother often churned, and Jan
knew all about it.</p>

<p>Over the edge of the churn leaned the little
girl. Then she gave a sudden cry and hurried
back to her chair. She had hardly sat
down in it before Mrs. Kent came back with
the spool of thread.</p>

<p>“There you are, Jan,” she said. “And
how is every one over at your house? I hear
you have a new visitor.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, only he’s going to be our Uncle
Ben now,” answered the little girl. “He’s
getting better, and we’re all well. And say,
Mrs. Kent, when you get through churning
will you please give me back my rubber
doll?”</p>

<p>“Give you back your rubber doll! Gracious
me, child! what do you mean? I
haven’t your rubber doll!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” insisted Jan, with a
funny little smile.</p>

<p>“Why, no, dear, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“You can’t see her,” said Janet. “She’s
in the butter.”</p>

<p>“In the <i>butter</i>!”</p>

<p>“I—I just dropped her in the churn,” explained
the little girl. “You left the cover
off, and I looked in to see if the butter had
come, and my rubber doll slipped, and now
she—now she’s in the churn!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent quickly lifted off the cover,
which Janet had put partly back on, and as
she did so she cried:</p>

<p>“There she is! Oh, Janet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t hurt her,” said Janet easily.
“She’s a rubber doll, you know, and water
or milk, or even butter, won’t hurt her. You
can give her back to me after you make the
butter.”</p>

<div class="figcenter id02">
<img src="images/illus-074.jpg" alt="" class="w100" />
<div class="w100">
<p>“OH, IT WON’T HURT HER,” SAID JANET EASILY. “SHE’S A RUBBER DOLL.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, but Janet dear! To drop a—a rubber
doll in my clean cream! And—and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, my doll was awful clean,” explained
Janet. “I washed her nice just before I
came over, really I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, that makes it better,” said Mrs.
Kent with a smile. “Wait and I’ll fish her
out for you, Janet. I guess my butter won’t
be spoiled after all. It’s a good thing your
doll is rubber.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought after she fell in,”
Janet said. “It won’t hurt her a bit. And
a lady once told my mamma that buttermilk
was good for freckles. Only my doll hasn’t
any.”</p>

<p>The doll was “fished” out of the churn,
wiped off and given back to Janet, who
tucked her under one arm and then hurried
home with the spool of thread.</p>

<p>The Curlytops waited eagerly for their
father to come home that night, for they
wanted to ask him about Silver Lake.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he told them, after supper, when
Janet and Ted had climbed on his knees and
Trouble was seated in Uncle Ben’s lap, “we
will spend our vacation at Silver Lake. I
think you will like it there.”</p>

<p>“Shall we have a tent?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“And a boat?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“An’—an’—a drum?” Trouble wanted to
know. “I wants a drum!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the drum!” said his
father with a laugh, “but we’ll have a tent,
and also a bungalow. We’ll eat in the tent
when it doesn’t rain. We’ll also have a boat,
for Silver Lake is a fine place for them. And
there will be lots of other things so you children
can have a good time. But now you
must get to bed. We will start for Silver
Lake to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And you can well believe that when to-morrow
came the Curlytops were up bright
and early. Such packing and getting ready
as there was! But Daddy and Mother Martin,
with the help of Patrick and Nora, managed
to get things in shape finally. The
automobile was brought around to the door.
Turnover, the cat, had been shut up in a little
crate, for she, also, was to be taken to Silver
Lake.</p>

<p>“If we only had Skyrocket!” sighed Jan.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll find out where we are and
come to us,” said Ted hopefully.</p>

<p>Trouble stood on the porch, holding Uncle
Ben’s hand.</p>

<p>At the sight of the man with the brown
beard, whom they had learned to like very
much, Ted and Jan had a new thought.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t Uncle Ben coming with us?”
cried the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course he is,” said Mr. Martin.
“I forgot to tell you about him. Uncle Ben
is coming with us, and will stay all summer
at Silver Lake. He is to have charge of the
boats there, for I own quite a number, and
also a pavilion and a soda-water stand.
Uncle Ben will have charge of them. It will
be just the place for him, Dr. Whitney says,
and will make him get well.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it will,” said Uncle Ben himself.
“I can’t tell you how much I thank
you, Mr. Martin. And I am delighted to
spend the summer with the Curlytops at Silver
Lake. Come on now, Trouble, we’ll get
aboard the auto.”</p>

<p>“All aboard for Silver Lake!” cried Ted
gaily.</p>

<p>They started off, the whole family and
Uncle Ben. Then, just as they reached a
turn in the road, they heard a voice shouting:</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Wait a minute!”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin stopped the car.</p>

<p>“It’s Constable Juke!” said Mrs. Martin,
looking around. “He is waving at us. I
guess he wants to speak to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe he’s found the burglars and
got back Miss Ransom’s queer box!” exclaimed
Ted.</p>

<p>“And maybe he’s found Skyrocket!”
echoed Jan.</p>

<p>Hurrying along the road, while the Curlytops
waited for him in the automobile, came
Constable Juke. What could he want?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />TROUBLE IN TROUBLE</h2>
</div>

<p>“Just a minute there, Mr. Martin! Just
a minute!” called Constable Juke, as he came
along the dusty road. “Sorry to call you
back,” he went on, as he came nearer. “I
heard you were going away to-day, and I
thought I’d get over before you left. But I
didn’t, and when I saw you going off down
the road I called to you.”</p>

<p>“Is it about the burglars that got into Miss
Ransom’s store and took the puzzle box?”
asked Ted.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t about them,” answered the
constable. “Though I hope to have ’em soon,
the rascals! Just wait until I catch my
breath and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>He sat down on a stone at the side of the
road, while Mr. Martin, Uncle Ben, and the
others in the automobile waited.</p>

<p>“Is it our dog Skyrocket?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s about him,” said the constable.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you found him?” cried the two
Curlytops both at once, while Trouble, who
heard the name of the pet he liked so much,
said:</p>

<p>“Me want Skywocket, too!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say I haven’t got your dog,”
went on the constable. “But I ran after you
to ask whether he’s black or white. You
see, I forgot whether you said white or black
when you told me about him, Mr. Martin.
And I don’t want to be looking for a black
dog, if it’s a white one that’s lost. And I
don’t want to be looking for a white dog if
it’s a black one that’s lost. Sometimes I had
it in mind that it was a black dog you owned,
and again it struck me that it was white. I
wanted to be sure about it. Now if he is a
white dog——”</p>

<p>“Skyrocket is mostly black,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“But he’s got a little white on him,” added
Janet.</p>

<p>“But you’d call him a black dog, I guess,”
said Daddy Martin. “And he was a curly
black dog, too, and not very large. Did you
find any such lost dog as that, Constable
Juke?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, I’m sorry to say,” was the
answer. “But now that I know for sure
what Skyrocket looks like I’ll write it down
on a piece of paper. Then I’ll have it with
me always, and I won’t forget. If I do,
every time I see a lost dog I’ll take out the
paper and read that Skyrocket was black.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll find him,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“So do I,” echoed Janet.</p>

<p>“I hope the same thing myself,” remarked
the constable. “Well, now I’m sure
in my own mind I can make a better hunt
for him. I sort of plan to look for your dog
and the burglars at the same time,” he added
to Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe the burglars that
robbed Mrs. Ransom’s store had anything to
do with Skyrocket’s going away,” said Mr.
Martin. “The children’s dog may have run
away himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sky wouldn’t do that!” cried Teddy.
Sometimes he called his dog “Sky” instead
of “Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Well, the best of dogs run away once in
a while,” said Mr. Martin. “However, we
wish you good luck, Constable Juke.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered the man. He had
written down on the back of an envelope,
with a stub of a pencil, the color of the Curlytops’
dog, so he would know Skyrocket if
he saw him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be getting back now,” said the
constable, as he got up and knocked some
dust from his shoes with a bunch of weeds
he pulled from the roadside. “Sorry to have
kept you waiting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we aren’t in any hurry,” replied Mr.
Martin. “We’re going to Silver Lake for
the summer.”</p>

<p>The automobile started off once more, Mr.
Martin steering it down the road on the way
to Silver Lake.</p>

<p>“When are we going to get there?” asked
Teddy, after his father and mother had finished
talking about the queer way Constable
Juke had run after them to ask about the
color of Skyrocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall get there some time this
afternoon,” answered Ted’s father.</p>

<p>“Do you like it near the water?” asked
Uncle Ben, for the children now called him
by this name all the while.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just love it!” exclaimed Janet.
“And it’s good for my dolls, too. They like
to be near the cool lake.”</p>

<p>“How did the rubber doll get over her
swim in the churn?” asked Uncle Ben, with
a smile, for Mrs. Kent had told the story of
Jan’s dropped doll.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s all right,” answered the little
girl. “Some of the buttermilk got inside
her, ’cause she’s got a hole in her back. But
I make believe feed her that way, lots of
times, so I guess she likes it.”</p>

<p>“Will you show me how to sail a boat on
Silver Lake, Uncle Ben?” asked Teddy, as
the automobile rolled on.</p>

<p>“Yes, if your father lets you go out in
one,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Will you, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“Will I what?” inquired Mr. Martin, for
he had not heard what Teddy said, as, just
then, a rooster ran across the road in front
of the automobile and Mr. Martin did not
want to run over the crowing chap.</p>

<p>“Will you let Uncle Ben take me out and
show me how to sail a boat?” asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so—if you’ll be careful,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be careful,” promised Uncle
Ben. “I used to be a sailor and I once
worked at a dock where rowboats and sailboats
were rented out,” he went on, “and lots
of times I’d take out parties of children. I
had to be very careful of them.”</p>

<p>That was one thing that Mr. and Mrs.
Martin liked Uncle Ben for—he was so kind
and careful about children. They felt that
they could trust the Curlytops and Trouble
with him at any time, even though they had
not known him very long.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know I’ll just love it at Silver
Lake!” exclaimed Jan, when she had heard
Ted talking about the boat rides he was to
have.</p>

<p>“We’ll have plenty of fun!” decided the
little boy. “I wish we’d hurry up and get
there!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” echoed his sister.</p>

<p>The day was rather warm, and after having
passed through a little village the automobile
was driven past a little wayside ice-cream
and soda-water stand.</p>

<p>“Let’s stop here and cool off,” said Mother
Martin. “I’m sure some ice-cream would be
good for the children, and I know I’d like a
drink of lemonade.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can stop here,” decided Daddy
Martin. “The automobile wants a drink,
too. I forgot to put water in when we
started. I’ll get some here.”</p>

<p>The ice-cream stand was kept by a boy
about fifteen years old. He said he took
charge of it every summer, as soon as school
was out, so he could earn money to help his
mother, who lived not far away.</p>

<p>“I’ll get some water for your auto while
you’re eating the ice-cream,” said the boy.
“I can get it from a well right back of my
stand. And you can sit over there under
the trees. It’s shady and cool there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll get out of the auto and walk
around a little,” decided Mrs. Martin. “One
of my feet is asleep.”</p>

<p>“Did you sing it to sleep, ’ike you sing me
to sleep?” asked Trouble.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” laughed his mother. “My
foot went to sleep of itself.”</p>

<p>What she meant was, as you know, that
her foot felt as if “pins and needles” were
sticking in it—you know how it is if you lie
down with your head on your arm sometimes.
When you try to move your fingers
they feel numb, as if they were “asleep.”</p>

<p>But a little walk around under the trees
near the roadside ice-cream stand made Mrs.
Martin’s foot “wake up;” and then the Curlytops,
Baby William, Uncle Ben, and Mr.
and Mrs. Martin sat down to enjoy the good
things which the boy set on a little table for
them.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll go and get the water for your
auto,” said the lad, after Mr. Martin had
paid him.</p>

<p>They sat there eating the ice-cream, and
sipping the lemonade, which Mr. Martin
also ordered, and in a little while a man
whom Mr. Martin knew drove past, stopping
his carriage in the road while the Curlytops’
father talked with him a moment.</p>

<p>“Come, children, we’ll go and see how the
boy is coming along putting the water in
daddy’s auto,” suggested Mrs. Martin, when
the ice-cream had been finished and the last
drop of lemonade was gone.</p>

<p>“This is a nice place here,” said Teddy, as
he got down from his chair and looked
around the country farm, near which the ice-cream
stand had been built.</p>

<p>“But not as nice as Silver Lake,” said
Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, course not!” agreed her brother.</p>

<p>“Where’s Trouble?” suddenly asked Mrs.
Martin, as she brushed some crumbs off her
dress, for she had opened a box of crackers
she had brought from a supply in the automobile.</p>

<p>“He was cleaning out his ice-cream dish
a moment ago,” answered Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“And he asked me if there was any left in
mine,” added Jan.</p>

<p>“But he’s gone!” cried her mother. “He
must have slipped away when I leaned over
to pick up my handkerchief that I had
dropped. We must find him!”</p>

<p>“I hope Trouble isn’t in trouble again,”
said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Ted, go and call your father,” said Mrs.
Martin. Her husband was out in the road
talking to the man who sat in a carriage.</p>

<p>As Teddy hurried out to do this, suddenly,
from somewhere back of the ice-cream stand,
came the shrill voice of Baby William.</p>

<p>“I dot him! I dot him!” cried Trouble.
“Tum on, Teddy—Jan! I dot him all wite!”</p>

<p>“What kind of trouble is Trouble in
now?” thought Uncle Ben.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />THE WIND BLEW</h2>
</div>

<p>Every one stood still on hearing Trouble’s
voice.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Mrs. Martin. “Did
you hear him?”</p>

<p>“I heard him,” said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“But where can he be?” asked Mrs. Martin.
“I can hear him, but I can’t see him.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” asked Mr. Martin, coming
back from the road, holding Teddy’s hand.
For his little boy had run down and told him
to come back, though Teddy forgot to say
what for. “What’s the matter?” asked Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Trouble again,” answered his
wife. “He slipped away after we had finished
our ice-cream, and now I can’t see him,
though he just now called to us.”</p>

<p>And, once more, came the voice of Trouble,
saying:</p>

<p>“I dot him! Tum an’ det him, Teddy!”</p>

<p>“He’s back of my stand!” cried the ice-cream
boy. “His voice comes from there.”</p>

<p>“Come on! Let’s look!” exclaimed Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>“Here I is!” came the voice.</p>

<p>“Why—why—that sounded just as if it
came from that dog kennel!” exclaimed Mrs.
Martin, pointing to one not far away.</p>

<p>“Is there a dog in there?” asked Uncle
Ben of the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes. At least, a puppy,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Trouble! Trouble, where are you?”
called his mother.</p>

<p>In answer a little tousled head was thrust
out of the opening, or front door, of the dog
kennel, and the head was followed by the
body of Trouble himself. He was smiling,
though his face was dirty, and in his arms
he held a little black puppy.</p>

<p>“I dot him!” he cried. “I dot our Skywocket
back aden!”</p>

<p>You should have heard Janet and Teddy
laugh then.</p>

<p>“That isn’t Skyrocket, Trouble, dear!”
said Janet.</p>

<p>“That isn’t our dog at all!” added Teddy,
laughing so hard he could hardly speak.</p>

<p>Trouble seemed much surprised. He held
the puppy, which was a very small one, away
from him so he might look at it better. Then
he brought it back into his lap as he sat on
the ground outside the kennel.</p>

<p>“Dis not Skywocket?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, no, Trouble. That dog belongs to
this boy,” said Mrs. Martin. “How did you
come to crawl in there with the puppy?”</p>

<p>“I wanted Skywocket,” explained
Trouble. “I did see a doggie. He wanted
me to tum an’ play wif him, an’ I did tum.
An’ I went into his little house, an’ we had
fun. Him is a nice doggie and he kissed me
on my face ’ist ’ike Skywocket!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say he did!” laughed Mrs.
Martin. “Most puppies will lick you with
their tongue if they get a chance. But put
the little doggie down now, Trouble, and
come to me. My! but you are dirty.”</p>

<p>“You can take him over to our house and
wash him,” suggested the ice-cream boy.
“We have lots of water at our house. My
little brother gets dirty, too, and has to be
washed every day.”</p>

<p>It did not take long to get Trouble clean,
with the big basin of warm water and a little
soap which the mother of the boy who kept
the ice-cream stand brought out for Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Now I think we are ready to travel on
again,” said Daddy Martin, when they were
once more in the automobile.</p>

<p>“Skywocket not come?” asked Trouble,
waving his hand toward the kennel of the
puppy into which he had crawled. “Me
want Skywocket.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t Skyrocket!” laughed Teddy,
though he felt quite sorry when he thought
of his lost pet. “That fellow is this boy’s
dog!”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’d hate to have any one take
him away,” said the ice-cream boy. “Did
your dog die?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Janet. “But he dis—he
dis—— Oh, what’s that funny word you
told me, Uncle Ben?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Disappeared,” answered Mr. Wilson.
“Skyrocket disappeared. That is, he went
off all at once, just like a skyrocket,” he
added.</p>

<p>“We don’t know if the same burglars took
him that took the queer box from Miss Ransom,”
said Teddy, “but Skyrocket is gone.
But of course we wouldn’t take your dog!”
he added quickly. “My little brother doesn’t
know dogs very well, and he surely did like
Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Skywocket nice dog!” exclaimed Trouble.
“Me ’ike dis dog, too!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you like a good many things,”
laughed Mrs. Martin, as she smoothed out
Baby William’s hair. “You like to get in
the dirt, too!”</p>

<p>Good-byes were said to the ice-cream boy
and his mother, and when a supply of lollypops
had been bought for Ted, Jan and
Trouble, Mr. Martin started the automobile,
and once more they were on their way to
Silver Lake.</p>

<p>Nothing more worth telling you about happened
until they reached the place where the
Curlytops expected to have such good times
with Uncle Ben on the water. The only little
thing that really did happen was that
Trouble dropped his lollypop when they
were almost at the lake, and he wanted his
father to stop the machine and get his bit of
candy on a stick.</p>

<p>But as Trouble had eaten more than half
of the lollypop, and as it was wet and sticky
and had dropped in the dust, Mrs. Martin
did not think it would be a good thing to
give it back to Trouble.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you another when we get to Silver
Lake,” she said, and with that the little
fellow was satisfied.</p>

<p>On chugged the automobile, up hill and
down, through the woods, now and then passing
through small towns, and finally Mr.
Martin said:</p>

<p>“There it is!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Ted and Jan both at once.</p>

<p>“Silver Lake!” answered their father.
“See it just ahead of you, at the bottom of
the hill, sparkling in the sun!”</p>

<p>He pointed, and the children saw it. They
had been to Silver Lake once or twice before,
but they did not remember much about it.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful place!” exclaimed
Uncle Ben, as he leaned forward to look.
“I’ve seen many a bit of water,” he added,
“but none as pretty as that.”</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Very much, indeed. I think I shall be
very happy there, and I know I’ll get well
and strong.”</p>

<p>Silver Lake was very much like its name.
It sparkled like a new, shiny piece of silver
in the sun. Around the lake were many
trees, making a regular picnic woods. And
indeed Silver Lake was what is called a picnic
resort. That is, a company had put up
on one of the shores a merry-go-round and a
place where you could “shoot the chutes”—that
is, slide down a wooden hill into the
water, riding in queer little wooden boats.
There was also a roller coaster, places to get
ice-cream and candy, and one place where
you could get a regular dinner.</p>

<p>There were many things to amuse children,
and grown-ups also. There were sailboats
and rowboats to hire, and there was a
motor boat in which one could ride all
around the lake for ten cents.</p>

<p>Silver Lake was quite a large body of
water, and the picnic grounds were only a
small part of it. Around the shores of the
rest of the lake were summer cottages and
bungalows, and it was to one of these bungalows,
which he owned, that Mr. Martin was
taking his family to spend their vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin also owned some of the boats
on the lake, and it was to take charge of these
boats, hiring them out to picnic parties who
wanted to ride in them, that Uncle Ben had
been brought to Silver Lake.</p>

<p>“You can stay on the boat pier in a little
office, and look after my sailboats, canoes,
and rowboats,” said Mr. Martin to Uncle
Ben. “That will keep you outdoors, and
make you well and strong.”</p>

<p>“And can we go out in boats with him?”
asked Teddy, as they alighted from the automobile
in front of the bungalow in which
they were to stay.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Mr. Martin. “I
think you will have lots of fun on the water
with Uncle Ben. He will not have to be busy
all the time, as he will have a man and a boy
to help him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just dandy here!” cried Teddy,
as he ran about on the soft ground under the
trees in front of the bungalow.</p>

<p>“We’ll have lots of fun!” echoed Janet.</p>

<p>Trouble got slowly down from his mother’s
arms. He walked this way and that, looking
out at the lake, which was shining like silver
among the trees, and he looked up at the
clouds floating overhead.</p>

<p>“Me ’ikes it here!” he decided. “Maybe
we find Skywocket!”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he cute!” cried Janet, and she
hugged and kissed her little brother. “But,
Trouble, dear, I don’t b’lieve Skyrocket will
come here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, either,” said Teddy.
“But still he might. Once we hid away up
in Tom Taylor’s barn, in the hay—’member,
Jan?—and Sky found us there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” agreed Janet. “But this
is a long way off.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think too much about your lost
dog,” advised Mrs. Martin. “If he is lost
he is lost, and that is all there is to it. It’s
too bad, of course, and I wish he were back.
But you must make the best of it, and, some
day, maybe we’ll have another dog.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ted slowly, as he thought it
over. “If I can’t have Skyrocket I don’t
want any dog.”</p>

<p>“Me, either,” said Janet. “But maybe
he’ll come back to us.”</p>

<p>“And maybe Tom Taylor and me—I mean
I—maybe we’ll find the burglars that went
into Miss Ransom’s store,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“How can you, when Tom Taylor isn’t
here?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed her brother. “I wish
Tom was here,” he went on. “I like to play
with him. Could he come and stay with us?”
he asked his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin looked at one another
and laughed in a queer way.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you got a secret?” cried Janet,
for she had seen her father and mother laugh
like this before. “Have you a secret?”</p>

<p>“Maybe—just a little one,” said her
mother, still smiling. “But now you children
play around, while daddy and I take the
things out of the auto and get ready for
supper.”</p>

<p>Supper was to be the first meal in the
bungalow at Silver Lake, and plenty of
things to eat had been brought along, so that
not much cooking would have to be done the
day the Curlytops arrived. Later on Nora,
the cook, was to come and help Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“I can help get supper,” said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“All right, then we’ll let you help,” said
Mrs. Martin. “Now, Jan and Ted, you take
good care of Trouble while I’m busy.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” promised the two Curlytops.</p>

<p>They had on their play clothes, and it was
not long before they were running here and
there, rolling about and tumbling about on
the soft carpet of green moss under the forest
trees. Trouble laughed and squealed
with delight.</p>

<p>There were a number of bungalows near
the one that Mr. Martin had bought for his
family, but, as yet, no one was in them. The
owners would be down in another week or
two, Mrs. Martin said.</p>

<p>Not far away from “Sunnyside,” as the
Martin bungalow was named, was the boat
dock owned by the children’s father, and
there were several sailboats and rowboats
tied there.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was helping Mrs. Martin get
supper, Mr. Martin was busy putting away
the groceries he had brought in the automobile,
and everything was being put in “ship-shape”
order, as Uncle Ben would say, when
Janet, followed by Trouble, came hurrying
into the bungalow.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried the little girl, and her
mother could see that she was much excited.
“Oh, dear! He’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Who’s gone?” asked Mrs. Martin,
though in another instant, not seeing Teddy,
she guessed who it was that Janet meant.</p>

<p>“Ted—Teddy!” gasped Janet. “He’s
gone! The wind blew him away!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chIX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />WHAT TROUBLE FOUND</h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Martin almost dropped the egg she
had in her hand, and Uncle Ben let fall to
the floor a pan he was going to put on the
stove in which to boil some potatoes. Luckily,
he had not yet put the water in it.</p>

<p>Daddy Martin came hurrying in from
where he was getting ready to run the automobile
under a shed. He stooped down and
looked closely at Janet.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” he asked. “Are you
playing some game, Jan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it isn’t a game!” exclaimed the
little Curlytop girl. “The wind blew, and it
just blew Teddy away. He’s out in the middle
of the lake now, I guess!”</p>

<p>“The lake! The wind! I see what she
means!” cried Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>Out of the door, and out on the bungalow
porch ran Uncle Ben, followed by Mr. and
Mrs. Martin. Jan, still holding Trouble by
the hand, followed more slowly.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Mr. Martin, pointing
toward Silver Lake, which, just then, was
glowing red from the setting sun. “Ted is
out in a boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I mean,” added Janet.
“Teddy got in a boat. He wanted me to
come, and Trouble, too, but I wouldn’t. But
Teddy got in a boat, and the wind did blow
him away, it did!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought the minute she
spoke about the wind!” cried Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy!” cried Mrs. Martin. “Is it
deep out there?” she asked her husband.</p>

<p>“No, not very,” he answered. “The little
tyke! I thought I told him not to get into
a boat alone,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Never mind about that, now!” cried Mrs.
Martin. “How are we going to get him
back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do that easily,” said Uncle Ben.
“I’ll row out and get him. I didn’t know he
knew enough to hoist the sail on a boat,” he
added.</p>

<p>“You can’t get him that way,” said Mr.
Martin. “The wind is blowing harder now,
and the boat is sailing faster, even if Ted
doesn’t know enough to fasten the sail in
the right way. You can’t get him by rowing
out to him, Uncle Ben.”</p>

<p>“Then how can we reach him?” asked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“In a motor boat,” her husband answered.
“There’s one over at the next pier. We can
row over there, start the motor boat, and
soon bring back Teddy and the sailboat.”</p>

<p>Uncle Ben and Daddy Martin hurried
down to where the rowboats were tied. Getting
into one, they quickly sent it skimming
over the water to the next pier. They could
row over much more quickly than they could
have walked around the shore.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin, with Jan and Trouble standing
beside her, eagerly watched, now and
then looking out to where the sailboat was
drifting slowly down the lake.</p>

<p>Pretty soon she heard the sound:</p>

<p>“Chug! Chug! Chuggity-chug-chug!”</p>

<p>“They’ve started!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Janet, too, knew what that sound meant.
It was the noise made by the engine of the
motor boat. Soon the boat, which ran something
like an automobile, and did not have
to be rowed nor need a sail blown by the
wind, moved away from the dock, and, with
Daddy Martin steering it, went out to bring
Teddy back to shore.</p>

<p>A sailboat can go very fast in a swift
breeze when the sail is rightly hoisted, but
even a fast sailboat is not as fast as a motor
boat, and soon Daddy Martin and Uncle Ben,
in their craft, were coming closer and closer
to the tiny ship in which Teddy was
riding.</p>

<p>The little fellow had not meant to go sailing
all alone in this way, and he was as much
surprised as any one when the boat moved
away from the dock. But he was a wise little
chap, and when he found himself going out,
away from the dock and the shore, he very
properly sat down on the bottom of the boat,
out of the way of the swinging boom, and
kept still. It was the best thing he could
have done.</p>

<p>But when he saw the motor boat coming
up behind him, and noticed his father and
Uncle Ben in it, Teddy could keep still no
longer.</p>

<p>“Daddy! Daddy!” he cried. “Take me
out! Take me home!”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! We’re coming! We’ll take
you home all right,” said his father.</p>

<p>“Sit down! Sit down!” shouted Uncle
Ben. “Sit down, Ted, or the boom will
knock you overboard.”</p>

<p>Teddy did not know exactly what the
“boom” was, but afterward he learned that
it was the big stick on the bottom of the sail
that swung from side to side. And if Ted
had sat up too straight this stick was likely
to hit him. Teddy knew that to fall “overboard”
meant to fall out of the boat. He
had fallen “overboard” off the raft that day
he played with Tom, and he had not forgotten.</p>

<p>So when Teddy heard Uncle Ben shouting
to him to sit down the little Curlytop boy
did this at once. And it is a good thing he
did, too, for a moment later the wind swung
around the lower part of the sail, with the
big, heavy wooden boom, and Teddy would
have been knocked into the lake by it if he
had not been on the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!” cried Uncle Ben, as he
saw that Teddy had minded. “Now stay
that way until we get you out.”</p>

<p>On chugged the motor boat, and soon it
was alongside the sailboat. Uncle Ben gave
a jump from the motor boat into the sailing
craft, and, in an instant, had loosed the ropes
that held up the sail. Down it came, and, as
the wind no longer had anything to blow
on, the sailboat moved more slowly. But, no
matter how fast it moved, the motor boat
was beside it now, and Mr. Martin tied both
craft together with a rope.</p>

<p>“Why, Teddy! what made you go sailing
all alone?” his father asked the little boy,
as he took him into the motor boat. “Didn’t
I tell you not to get into a boat unless your
mother, Uncle Ben, or I were with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Daddy. But I—I—forgot!” confessed
Teddy. “I won’t do it again!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Mr. Martin.
“And now how did you come to haul up the
sail? I’m sure there wasn’t any sail on this
boat when we arrived at Silver Lake. How
did you get the sail up, Teddy? You aren’t
strong enough to hoist it yourself.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t do it,” admitted Teddy. “A
man did it for me.”</p>

<p>“A man? What man?” Mr. Martin
asked, and he looked in surprise at Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it, that’s sure,” said Mr. Wilson.
“And I didn’t see any strange man
around the dock.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Mr. Martin. “Are you sure,
Teddy, that a man hoisted the sail for you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t ask him to,” went on the
little boy. “I was playing around with Jan
and Trouble. You were up in the bungalow—you
and Uncle Ben and mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that part,” said Mr. Martin.
“Go on. Tell me who put up the sail for
you. He shouldn’t have done it, whoever it
was.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t do it for <i>me</i>, zactly,” went
on Teddy. “I was playing, and I said to
Jan, ‘let’s get in a boat’ and she said, ‘no,’
and I went down to get in and I saw a man
then putting up the sail.”</p>

<p>“Did the man say anything?” asked Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>“He looked at me kind of funny,” replied
Teddy. “An’ then he said: ‘What? You
here? Then I’ve got to run!’”</p>

<p>“The man was surprised, was he, Ted?”
asked his father.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was terrible s’prised, I guess,”
answered the little chap.</p>

<p>“Did he run away?” asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes, he ran away as soon as he saw me.
But he left the sail up on the boat, and I
thought maybe daddy sent him to put it up
for me, and I got into the boat, and the wind
blew, and it did blow me away, it did.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Janet told us that part!” said his
father. “It’s lucky she saw you before you
were blown clear across the lake. I can’t
understand what man it was, though, who
hoisted the sail,” said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Have you any man working for you
around the boats?” asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Not yet, though I’m going to hire a man
and a boy to help you,” answered the father
of the Curlytops. “This man must have
been a stranger, though why he should hoist
the sail on one of my boats and then run at
the sight of Teddy is more than I can make
out.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he has been using the sailboat
while you were at home in Cresco,” suggested
Uncle Ben. “He didn’t hear us come,
and he came down to the dock to take a ride
as he had been used to doing. Then he saw
Teddy. He thought he might be caught, so
he ran away.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s how it was,” agreed Mr.
Martin. “But I’d like to know who the
man was. What did he look like, Teddy,
boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he—he was—he was just a—man!”</p>

<p>“I know,” replied his father. “But was
he a man like Uncle Ben or like me?”</p>

<p>Teddy looked first at his father, then at
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“He was like both of you,” he said.
“That’s the kind of man he was.”</p>

<p>“We can’t tell very much from that,” said
Mr. Wilson, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, but we must be on the watch,” said
Mr. Martin. “I don’t want strange men
hoisting the sails on my boats. They might
sail off in one and not come back.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a burglar!” exclaimed
Teddy. “I guess he looked like a burglar—only
I never saw one.”</p>

<p>“No, I presume you never did,” agreed
his father. “But we must get back to shore,
or your mother will be worried more than
she is now. Though she can see that you are
all right, I suppose. Anyhow I’ll make
sure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin stood up in the motor boat and
held Teddy high in his arms, so that Mrs.
Martin, on shore, could see that the little boy
was safe. Teddy’s mother waved her handkerchief,
to let her husband know that she
had seen and understood.</p>

<p>Then the motor boat was started again,
and back to the dock it went, towing the sailing
craft.</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy, what made you do it!” cried
his mother as she clasped him in her arms.</p>

<p>“He won’t do it again!” declared Mr.
Martin, after he had explained how it happened.</p>

<p>“But it was very curious!” said Mrs. Martin.
“I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“I wants to go in sailboat!” cried Trouble,
as they all walked up from the lake to the
bungalow.</p>

<p>“Now let’s settle this once and for all,”
said Mr. Martin solemnly. “None of you
children is to get into a boat unless one of
us is with you—don’t forget!”</p>

<p>He shook his finger at the two Curlytops
and at Trouble. They knew what this meant,
and each one promised.</p>

<p>“Come to supper!” called Uncle Ben a
little later, and they sat down to the table
which had been set under the tent in front of
the bungalow.</p>

<p>Never was there a jollier meal. Then came
a delightful time of sitting under the trees
in the cool of the evening, until Mrs. Martin
said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Well, Trouble has gone to by-low land
in my arms, and I think it must be time for
Ted and Jan to see what they are going to
dream about. They’ve had a long day of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed Uncle Ben.
“Come, Curlytops—tumble in! as we used
to say on shipboard when we went to bed.”</p>

<p>There were a number of beds in the bungalow,
and soon the Curlytops, as well as
Trouble, were asleep.</p>

<p>Teddy was having a queer dream, about
sailing in a boat with his dog Skyrocket
perched up on top of the mast, when suddenly
the little Curlytop lad was awakened
by hearing Trouble calling to him. Ted
opened his eyes to see his little brother, in
his baggy pyjamas, standing beside the cot
bed where Teddy slept. Trouble lifted up
something round and black and shiny and
toppled it over into Ted’s cot.</p>

<p>“’Ook what Trouble found!” cried the little
fellow. “Trouble det him down by de
’ake, and bringed him in. He’s nice, but he
not as nice as Skywocket! He don’t bark,
but he stick out hims head an’ pull it in
a’den! ’Ook what Trouble found!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER X<br /><br />JANET’S FLOWERS</h2>
</div>

<p>At first Ted was not quite sure whether
he was fully awake or whether he was still
dreaming. But when he took a second look
at his little brother Trouble, standing beside
the cot bed, Ted began to feel pretty sure he
was no longer sleeping.</p>

<p>“’Ook what Trouble found!” went on the
little fellow, laughing joyously. “Hims is
’ike a big stone, but hims isn’t a stone. Hims
is a’ive, hims is!”</p>

<p>Ted looked at the funny, half-round, black
object Trouble held. If Ted’s eyes had been
more widely opened, and if he had not been
so suddenly awakened from his sleep, he
might have known what it was Baby William
had found so early in the morning.</p>

<p>The night had been rather warm, and, to
be cooler, Teddy had left his feet and legs uncovered.
One bare leg was outside the covers
on the cot now, and the first thing Teddy
knew he felt something cold and clammy
crawling over his leg, and then something
scratched him.</p>

<p>“Oh! Ouch!” cried Teddy, sitting up in
bed. “What have you there, Trouble? Did
you put a snake on me?”</p>

<p>“Hims no snake!” laughed Baby William.
“’Ook at him.”</p>

<p>Then Teddy rubbed his eyes so he could see
better, and he saw what it was Trouble had
brought in. It was crawling about on the
bed now—sliding on and off Ted’s bare leg,
and the little Curlytop boy saw what made
the scratchy feeling.</p>

<p>“It’s a mud turtle!” cried Teddy. “Oh,
where’d you get him, Trouble?”</p>

<p>“Trouble find mud turkle in woods, down
by lake,” was the answer. “Trouble bring
turkle in to Ted. Nice turkle!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s nice all right,” agreed Ted, with
a laugh. “But I don’t want him in my bed.
Take him out, Trouble, and I’ll get dressed.
It’s morning!” cried Ted, as he saw the sun
shining into the bungalow.</p>

<p>“Trouble give turkle to Jan,” murmured
the little chap as he reached for the crawling
creature. “Jan ’ike a turkle, too!”</p>

<p>“No, don’t put it in Janet’s bed!” advised
Teddy.</p>

<p>“All wite,” assented Trouble. “Me give
him Unk Ben!”</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that, either!” cried Teddy,
catching his little brother, just as Baby
William was about to toddle into the room
where Mr. Wilson slept. “Take the turtle
outside, Trouble. I’ll come out pretty soon
and we’ll have some fun. Don’t let him run
away.”</p>

<p>“All wite,” agreed Trouble, and out he
went with the queer creature.</p>

<p>“What’s going on out there?” called Mrs.
Martin from her room. “Trouble, where are
you?” she asked, looking over to the crib
where Baby William had been put to sleep
the night before. Mrs. Martin saw that the
crib was empty, and she guessed what had
happened. Trouble had awakened early, and
had slipped out without waiting to be
dressed. “What are you doing?” his mother
called.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right,” answered Teddy, who
was dressing himself now. “He went down
to the lake, found a mud turtle and put it in
my bed. He woke me up. The turtle
crawled on my bare leg, and I thought at
first it was a snake. Trouble wanted to put
the turtle in Jan’s bed and then in Uncle
Ben’s, but I wouldn’t let him.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” said his father. “Trouble,
put the turtle down and come in here!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Trouble, and he did
what he was told at once, as he nearly always
did when his father spoke.</p>

<p>In a little while the two Curlytops were
dressed, as was the rest of the family, and
soon they were sitting down to the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>“Where’s the turtle, Trouble?” asked
Jan, as she got up from the table. “I want
to see it, but I don’t want it in bed with
me.”</p>

<p>Trouble looked around on the floor.</p>

<p>“Turkle gone!” he said, not seeing his new
pet.</p>

<p>“Gone!” cried Ted. “Why, I told you to
watch him, Trouble. We could ’a’ had a lot
of fun with that turtle, and now you let him
get away!”</p>

<p>“Did you put him anywhere, Trouble?”
asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Ess, me put him somewhere,” answered
Baby William, still stooping down and looking
around the floor.</p>

<p>“Well, where’d you put him?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>Trouble shook his head.</p>

<p>“Me fordet!” he said simply.</p>

<p>That was often the way with Trouble. He
would sometimes put his toys, or one of
Janet’s dolls, maybe, away and forget where
he had left it.</p>

<p>“I guess he put the turtle down on the floor
when I called him to breakfast,” said Mrs.
Martin, “and the turtle crawled off. Never
mind, there’ll be plenty else to play with.”</p>

<p>“And maybe we can find another turtle,”
said Ted. “Come on, Jan, we’ll look.”</p>

<p>“I have something else I want to do now,”
answered the little girl.</p>

<p>“All right. Then I’ll go on a turtle hunt,”
decided Ted. “Come on, Trouble. Show me
where you found the one that got away.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far, and keep out of the
boats!” called Mrs. Martin to her two little
boys, as they walked away, hand in hand.</p>

<p>There was quite a lot of work to do about
the bungalow to get it in order for the summer
visit, and soon Mrs. Martin, her husband,
and Uncle Ben were busy. Trouble
and Ted were in plain sight down on the
shore of the lake, looking for turtles, so
their mother was not worried about them.
Janet was on the porch, taking some of her
toys from the box in which they had been
packed, and Uncle Ben was getting ready
to fix the rudder of the motor boat. The rudder
was under water, and Uncle Ben said he
would put on a pair of rubber boots to wade
out and see what was wrong with the steering
gear.</p>

<p>“Hello! Something is wrong here!” exclaimed
Uncle Ben, as he put his left foot in
one of the pair of boots that Daddy Martin
brought out of a closet for him.</p>

<p>“Something wrong? Aren’t they big
enough for you?” asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“One is, but the other doesn’t seem to be,”
answered the man who had once been a
sailor. “There’s something in this boot. I
can’t get it on!”</p>

<p>He had his foot half way in, but now he
pulled it out and thrust in his hand. As he
did this Uncle Ben gave a laugh.</p>

<p>“I’ve found Trouble’s lost turtle,” he
called.</p>

<p>“Where was it?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“In this rubber boot,” answered Uncle
Ben. “Trouble must have dropped the turtle
in the boot, and then he forgot about it.
Here it is!”</p>

<p>He drew forth his hand and there, surely
enough, out came the turtle in it.</p>

<p>“No wonder I couldn’t get my foot in!”
laughed Uncle Ben. “The turtle took up all
the room.”</p>

<p>“Put it in a box so it can’t get away,” said
Daddy Martin. “The children can play with
it. They won’t hurt it, and the turtle isn’t
the snapping kind, so it won’t bite them.”</p>

<p>The queer pet Trouble had found was put
in a wooden box, high enough on the sides to
keep the creature from crawling out. Then
Uncle Ben put on the other rubber boot and
fixed the motor boat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trouble and Teddy, walking
up and down the shore of the lake, were looking
for more turtles. They did not see any,
but they found plenty of other things to
make them happy. There were frogs, and
there were little fishes swimming close to
shore in the shallow water. But every time
the boys tried to catch a fish or a frog they
missed. The fishes gave little flips of their
tails and swam away, and the frogs hopped
into deeper water.</p>

<p>There were other little swimming creatures,
however—tiny black tadpoles, that,
some day, would turn into frogs. And by
scooping up water in their cupped hands Ted
and Trouble caught some of the “taddies.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put ’em in a can and watch ’em
turn into frogs,” suggested Ted. “That’ll
be fun, won’t it, Trouble?”</p>

<p>“Um—yes,” agreed the smaller boy.</p>

<p>Ted found an old tomato can, filled it with
water, and then he and his brother caught
more tadpoles. Soon they had a dozen swimming
around in the water of the can.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll sit down and watch ’em turn
into frogs,” said Ted, as he carried the can
over to a shady place.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had told him that the tadpoles,
though they had a tail at first, lost it after a
while, and then grew two feet, and then,
later, had four feet and legs, and finally were
frogs.</p>

<p>For some little time Ted and Trouble sat
and looked into the can of wiggling tadpoles.
Then, as no change took place and as not a
single frog hopped out, Ted exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they won’t change while we
watch ’em. Let’s go away now, an’ when we
come back they’ll be frogs.”</p>

<p>“All wite,” agreed Trouble. They did not
know that it takes many days for a tadpole
to change into a frog.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s go get a cookie, and then
we’ll see what Jan’s doing,” suggested Ted,
as he led his brother toward the bungalow.
“Maybe she’ll come with us an’ have some
fun now. Maybe Uncle Ben will take us out
in a boat. Shall we do that, Trouble?”</p>

<p>“All wite—’ess!” was the answer.</p>

<p>Janet was tired of her unpacking, and
after each of the children had been given a
sugar cookie by Mrs. Martin, they started
out again to look for something to do. There
were many ways of having fun at Silver
Lake, even though the picnic season had not
started yet.</p>

<p>When it did, and when the merry-go-round
and the shoot-the-chutes were going, there
would be more ways of having fun.</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far off, children!” called
Mrs. Martin to the Curlytops and Trouble.
“Uncle Ben is going to take you for a boat
ride before dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“We’re just going a little way,” added
Janet.</p>

<p>The three strolled toward the lake, down
the winding path. Janet saw, in a clump of
trees, some pretty blue flowers.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what I’m going to do!” she
cried. “I’m going to pick a bouquet for
mother to put on the table. It looks so
pretty! I’ll get some flowers!”</p>

<p>“I’ll pick some green ferns to go with the
bouquet,” added Ted, as he saw a clump near
the blue flowers. “Come on, Trouble, you
help me pick the ferns.”</p>

<p>Janet started toward the clump of blue
flowers. She did not know that the posies
grew on the edge of a hole that was filled with
water and very sticky mud. As the grass
grew tall near the edge of the hole Janet
could not see it.</p>

<p>Up to the pretty blossoms she ran, and she
reached her hands out to pick some. Ted,
who was watching her, suddenly saw his sister
go out of sight. He knew she had fallen
down, but he did not know just how it had
happened.</p>

<p>“Janet! Janet!” he cried. “What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Ted!” she answered. “Oh, Teddy, I fell
in! Come and get me out!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XI<br /><br />TROUBLE IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>

<p>Teddy Martin ran to the edge of the little
bank over the top of which he had seen Janet’s
head a moment before. The boy had
his hands full of ferns, but he dropped these
as he ran forward, calling:</p>

<p>“I’m coming, Jan! I’m coming! Wait
for me!”</p>

<p>“I can’t get out!” Janet answered. “I’m
stuck fast!</p>

<p>“And I’m going down farther all the
while!” she called. “Oh, Oh! You must
get me out, Teddy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Janet! Yes, I’ll get you out!” cried
Teddy. He flung himself face downward on
the grassy bank below which Janet was
caught in a trap of mud. It was soft mud,
and did not, of course, hurt her, but it was
so sticky that she was held fast.</p>

<p>“Can’t you pull your legs out, Janet, and
walk over to me?” asked Teddy. “If you
could get over here I could take hold of your
hands and pull you the rest of the way out.
Try to pull your legs loose!”</p>

<p>“I did try,” Janet answered. “I can pull
one leg out, but then the other leg sticks down
deeper in the mud. Then when I try to pull
my first leg out, that’s stuck, too.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you pull both your legs out together?”
asked Teddy, as he lay on the top
of the grassy bank and looked down at his
sister.</p>

<p>“Nope! I can’t pull both my legs out at
once,” she answered. “’Cause if I did I’d
fall down.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I guess I’ve got to come down
and get you,” said Teddy, as he thought
about the matter. “You stay there, Janet,
and I’ll come down and pull you out. I’ll
hold you so you can pull both your legs out
at the same time.”</p>

<p>He started to get up, but his sister called
to him.</p>

<p>“No, don’t come down here, Teddy!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“’Cause if you do, you’ll be stuck, too,
and then we’ll both be stuck in this sticky
mud, and we can’t get out, and nobody will
know we’re here, and nobody can take
Trouble home, and——”</p>

<p>“That’s so—I forgot about Trouble,” said
Teddy. “And that is pretty sticky mud,
isn’t it, Jan?”</p>

<p>“It’s terribly sticky!” answered the little
girl. “It’s just like that time when I sat
down in the fly paper. I guess you better go
and get mother or daddy or Uncle Ben.
They can get me out.”</p>

<p>“Wait! Maybe I can do it myself!” said
Teddy, after a bit. “If I had a rope I could
throw it to you, and you could take hold of
it and I could stand up here, where there
isn’t any mud, and pull you out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you haven’t any rope,” said
Janet.</p>

<p>Teddy thought some more.</p>

<p>“No, there isn’t any rope,” he said. “But
if I could find a piece of wild grapevine, that
would be as good as a rope. Don’t you ’member,
when we went to Grandpa’s Cherry
Farm, how we swung on a wild grapevine in
the woods, just like a swing?”</p>

<p>“I ’member,” Janet answered. “Please
go and get me a wild grapevine rope, Teddy,
and pull me out. My shoes are all full of
mud.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s a lot on your legs, too,”
her brother said. “Well, I’ll see if I can
find a grapevine. If I can’t, I’ll get daddy
or Uncle Ben—they’ll pull you out, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Trouble?” asked Janet, as her
brother stood up and started to walk away.</p>

<p>“That’s so—mustn’t forget him,” answered
Teddy. “He was picking ferns when
I heard you yell, but I don’t see him now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must find him!” cried Janet.
“If he goes away by himself maybe he’ll
fall into a mud hole too.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find Trouble first, and then I’ll go
and get the grapevine and pull you out,”
decided the little boy. Of course it might
have been better if he had run at once and
told his father or his mother what had happened
to Janet. But Teddy liked to do
things for himself, and if he could help his
sister out of the bog he wanted to do it.</p>

<p>“Hi, Trouble! where are you?” cried
Teddy as he looked toward the spot where
he had left his little brother, picking ferns.</p>

<p>At first there was no answer, and, for a
moment, Teddy feared that Baby William
had wandered away and become lost, or perhaps
had fallen into some swamp hole. But,
in a few seconds, after he had called again,
Teddy heard some baby laughter.</p>

<p>“Trouble, are you hiding away from me
in the grass?” asked Teddy, for sometimes
the little chap did this. “Are you hiding?”
asked Teddy in louder tones.</p>

<p>“No, I’se playin’!” was the answer. “I
got nudder turkle!”</p>

<p>“You have?” cried Teddy, running toward
the spot from which Trouble’s voice
sounded. “Say, you’re great on finding
turtles! Yes, you have found one!” he went
on, when he reached Baby William’s side.
He saw the little boy sitting down in a grassy
hollow, and near him, slowly crawling, was
a mud turtle—much larger than the one
Trouble had found that morning and put in
Teddy’s cot.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s dandy!” cried Ted. “We’ll
keep ’em both, and maybe we can get up a
show with ’em. Come on, Trouble. Jan’s
stuck in the mud, and I’ve got to get her out.
I’ve got to find a wild grapevine.”</p>

<p>“Jan in mud?” asked Trouble, looking up
into Ted’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s away down in a deep mud hole.
We’ve got to pull her out.”</p>

<p>Carrying the turtle in one hand, with the
other Teddy led Trouble to the edge of the
grassy bank, where the little fellow could
look down and see his sister stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>“Oh! Too bad!” said Trouble, in a gentle
voice, as he saw the plight of poor Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is too bad,” agreed the little girl.
“I didn’t see the mud hole when I went to
get the blue flowers.”</p>

<p>She still held a bouquet of them in her
hand.</p>

<p>“Now you stay here with Janet, Trouble,
and I’ll go and get a grapevine for a rope,”
said Teddy. “Sit right here and don’t go
away.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Baby William. “I
give turtle grass for hims to eat breakshust!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can feed the turtle his breakfast,”
agreed Janet. “And don’t be too
long, Teddy,” she begged. “’Cause I think
I’m sinking farther in all the while.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come right back,” he promised, as
he ran toward the tangled woodland where
he thought some grapevines might grow.
And Teddy was lucky enough to find some,
so that, in a little while, he came back with
one trailing after him.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll pull you out, Janet!” he cried.
“This is as good as a rope.”</p>

<p>He stripped the leaves and little branches
from the long, thin vine, which is really a
rope of the woods, and then, holding one end,
Ted tossed the other to his sister, who was
standing below him in the bog. She caught
it with one hand, holding the blue flowers in
the other.</p>

<p>“Hold fast now, I’m going to pull!” cried
Teddy. “I’ll pull and you wiggle your feet,
and then they’ll come loose out of the mud
and you can walk over where it’s hard
ground.”</p>

<p>Well, Teddy, pulled and Janet tried to
keep hold of her end of the grapevine rope,
but as Teddy was stronger than she was, and
as he was pulling with two hands, while she
was holding with only one, and as the mud
was very sticky, you can imagine what happened.</p>

<p>Teddy pulled the grapevine away from
his sister, and she nearly fell over backward
into the muddy puddle just behind her.</p>

<p>“You must take hold with both hands!”
cried Teddy, as he, too, almost toppled over.
“Take hold with both hands, and I’ll pull
with both hands, and I’ll get you out.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got only one hand,” declared Janet.
“I must hold on to my flowers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let the flowers go!” ordered Teddy.</p>

<p>“No, I want ’em!” insisted Janet.</p>

<p>“Then I can’t pull you out,” was Teddy’s
reply.</p>

<p>Janet thought this over for a moment, and
then she said:</p>

<p>“Well, I can throw my flowers to you up
there on the bank. You can give ’em to
Trouble to keep, and then I can take hold
with both hands.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can do that!” agreed Teddy.
“Go ahead! Throw me your flowers. I’ll
give ’em to Trouble.”</p>

<p>“But don’t let the mud turtle eat ’em!”
pleaded Janet, as she tossed the pretty bouquet
to her brother. The gathering of the
blue flowers had gotten Janet into a lot of
trouble.</p>

<p>“My turkle eats grass—hims don’t like
flowers!” said Baby William, as Ted laid
the blossoms down on the ground beside his
little brother.</p>

<p>Janet now had both hands free, and she
took a good hold of the grapevine rope.
Teddy braced his feet in the grass, and began
to pull. Janet pulled also, lifting her
feet out of the sticky mud, and, with a queer,
sucking sound as she lifted her legs, first the
right and then the left, she soon found herself
free of the bog. She stepped out on firm
ground, and was soon upon the bank with
Ted and Trouble.</p>

<p>“Oh, what an awful lot of mud!” cried
Teddy, as he looked at his sister’s feet. And
well might he say that, for she was covered
with muck up to her waist.</p>

<p>“I guess I better wade out in the lake, with
my shoes and stockings on, and wash off,”
said Janet. “I can’t get any wetter, but I
can get a little cleaner.”</p>

<p>“I guess you can,” decided Teddy.</p>

<p>He and Trouble (who carried the flowers,
while his brother held the turtle) walked to
the shore of the lake where the water was
shallow. There Janet waded in and splashed
around. Of course she got very wet—and
with her clothes, shoes and stockings on, too!—but
the mud was washed off.</p>

<p>“Where have you children been, and what
have you been doing?” cried Mrs. Martin,
when the Curlytops and Trouble walked up
to the bungalow Sunnyside a little later.</p>

<p>“I’ve been picking a bouquet for you,
Mother,” answered Janet, and she held out
the blue flowers. “Aren’t they pretty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, they are very nice, and
thank you for them. But did you have to
wade in the lake up to your waist after
them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I fell in the mud and then I had
to wash off,” explained Janet.</p>

<p>“And I found annuver mud turkle!” cried
Trouble.</p>

<p>Then the children told their mother what
had happened.</p>

<p>After dinner, when Janet had been washed
again and dried and had had clean clothes
put on her, Uncle Ben took the three children
out on the lake in a little motor boat.
It was great fun for them to go riding about
the silvery water, the engine of the boat
making a chugging sound which Trouble
liked very much.</p>

<p>Silver Lake was so large that Uncle Ben
did not have time to take the children all
around it.</p>

<p>“Some day,” he said, “we’ll put up a
lunch and go on a regular voyage all around
the shores in the big motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Shall we get shipwrecked?” asked Ted
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I hope not!” laughed Uncle Ben. “I was
shipwrecked once, and that was enough.
But now we are going to stop here. I have
to get some rowboats your father has
bought.”</p>

<p>He steered the motor craft up to a little
pier about a mile from Sunnyside. To this
pier a number of small boats were tied.
After some talk with a man Uncle Ben tied
to the back of the boat in which the Curlytops
sat five of the rowboats, strung out one
after the other, like beads on a string.</p>

<p>“Are we going to take ’em home?” asked
Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Uncle Ben. “Your
father needs more boats to hire out at his
dock near the picnic grounds, and he bought
these. I am going to paint them red, like all
his boats.”</p>

<p>“May I help paint?” Teddy asked.</p>

<p>“Me too?” cried Janet.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see about it,” promised Uncle
Ben. “I’m afraid you would get more paint
on your hands and faces than you would on
the boats. But maybe I’ll let you paint a
little with a small brush.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be fun!” cried both children.
“Do let us!”</p>

<p>Off they started once more, hauling the
rowboats after them in a long line back of
the motor craft. Trouble wanted to climb
back into the nearest rowboat, but they would
not let him, of course.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was steering the big boat, and
pulling the smaller ones, in toward the
Sunnyside dock when suddenly something
jumped from the water with a splatter of
drops and seemed to leap over the rowboat
nearest the motor boat. Then the shining
object fell back into the lake again with a
splash.</p>

<p>“What was that?” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Did somebody throw something?” Janet
asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a turtle,” said Trouble.</p>

<p>“That was a fish that jumped out of the
water and clean over the rowboat,” said
Uncle Ben. “Fish sometimes leap out of
the water that way when they want to catch
a bug or a fly that is just above them. But
I did not know there were such large fish in
Silver Lake. I must bring a hook, line, and
pole the next time I come out.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to fish, too!” declared Teddy.</p>

<p>“So’m I!” added Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll get up a fishing party!” agreed
Uncle Ben. “Maybe we can catch enough
for a meal.”</p>

<p>The rowboats were tied up at Daddy Martin’s
dock, and for the next few days Uncle
Ben was busy painting them. Teddy and
Janet were both allowed to use a small brush,
and really they did quite well, for they were
careful.</p>

<p>The only thing that happened was that
once, when Trouble came close to watch him,
Teddy splattered some red paint on the face
of Trouble’s beloved rag doll.</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy Martin! ’ook what you did!”
cried Trouble. “I’m goin’ to tell mozzer!
My doll’s all wed!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” Teddy said, sorry
enough about what had happened. “Anyhow
it makes his cheeks look nice and red.”
Trouble hadn’t thought of this.</p>

<p>“It does make him ’ook pittier,” he
agreed. “I’m glad ’oo did it, Teddy.”</p>

<p>The Curlytops had lots of fun at Silver
Lake. Gradually the bungalow was put in
order, and Nora came to cook and help with
the work. Then Mrs. Martin could take
long walks in the woods with the children,
and they often went out on the lake with
Uncle Ben, having many good times on the
silvery water.</p>

<p>It was just before supper one evening, and
Ted and Janet had come in from sailing with
Uncle Ben. Trouble had not gone, as he was
asleep, but now he had awakened, and he was
freshly washed and dressed.</p>

<p>“Take Trouble for a little walk down the
path, Ted and Jan,” their mother said.
“But don’t go far away, for supper will soon
be ready.”</p>

<p>“All right,” they answered, and soon the
two Curlytops were leading their little
brother by the hand.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down to the ice-house,” proposed
Teddy. “They’re taking cakes of ice
out now and we can watch.”</p>

<p>The ice-house was one partly owned by Mr.
Martin. In the winter, when Silver Lake
was frozen, men cut big chunks of ice from
it, and packed it away in sawdust in a small
house, not far from shore. In the summer
the ice was taken out and used to make ice-cream
and to cool soda=water.</p>

<div class="figcenter id03">
<img src="images/illus-132.jpg" alt="" class="w100" />
<div class="w100">
<p>“OH, TEDDY MARTIN! ’OOK WHAT YOU DID!” CRIED TROUBLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cakes of ice were so large and heavy
that they were lifted from the house and
lowered to the ground outside by a rope and
pulley. The pulley was up near the roof of
the house, and the rope dangled to the
ground. The ice was hoisted up just as you
may have seen a piano hoisted up to the second
or third story of a house. The Curlytops
used to like to watch the men lift the ice
out by the rope and pulley.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all done!” exclaimed Janet,
much disappointed, when she and her two
brothers reached the ice-house. “They’re
all done, and they’re gone!”</p>

<p>“But they’ve left the rope where we can
reach it,” said Teddy. “Oh, Jan, I know
what we can do!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What?” she asked.</p>

<p>“We can make believe Trouble is a cake
of ice, and hoist him up by the rope,” went
on Ted. “Come on—let’s do it. Trouble,
do you want a ride in the air?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’ess! Me want wide in air!” said
the little fellow eagerly.</p>

<p>“All right! Then you’re going to have
one!” laughed Ted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XII<br /><br />COMPANY IN CAMP</h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Martin was sitting on the front
porch of the bungalow. She had just finished
writing a letter, which she hoped would
bring more happiness and fun to the Curlytops.
Uncle Ben and Daddy Martin were
washing themselves, after having been at
work among the boats and at the dock. In
the house, or bungalow I suppose I had better
call it, Nora was finishing the supper
preparations.</p>

<p>“Yes, this ought to make Ted and Jan
happy,” said Mrs. Martin to herself as she
sealed the letter she had written. “I’ll have
Uncle Ben take it to the post-office after supper.
They won’t miss Skyrocket so much if
everything turns out the way I want it to,”
thought Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>For Ted and Jan had certainly missed
their pet dog very much. Skyrocket had
been with them on nearly all their trips to
Cherry Farm, to their uncle’s or aunt’s, and
to other places, and now, since the dog had
vanished in such a queer way from the woodshed,
the Curlytops had sorrowed for him
very much. Even Turnover, the cat, did not
make up for Skyrocket. And seeing how
much Ted and Janet thought about their
missing dog, even when they were having
fun on the water with Uncle Ben, Mrs. Martin
decided to write the letter she had just
finished.</p>

<p>She was getting up from her chair, to go
inside the bungalow to see if Nora needed
any help about the supper, when, suddenly,
the mother of the Curlytops saw a curious
sight. This was a glimpse of Baby William
being raised up off the ground and swaying
to and fro on the end of a rope in front of
the ice-house.</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Martin could not believe
that she really saw this. But when she
had brushed her hand over her eyes, to
make sure that she was wide awake, she
felt certain that what she had seen was
real.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble! William! Ted! Janet!
What are you doing?” cried their mother,
and, dropping her letter, she ran off the
porch, calling as loudly as she could:</p>

<p>“Daddy! Uncle Ben! Come quick! The
baby is hanging from the end of a rope!”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin and Uncle Ben had just finished
washing, and when they heard the call
they ran down the path after Mrs. Martin.
They, too, saw just what she saw—Trouble
dangling from the end of a rope that ran over
a pulley, or wooden wheel, near the top of the
ice-house. And as the two men watched they
saw Baby William slowly go down, and then
go up again, just as an elevator goes down
and comes up.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s hauling Trouble up and
down, just like a cake of ice!” cried Daddy
Martin.</p>

<p>“That’s what they are!” said Uncle Ben.
“I wonder who it is?”</p>

<p>The next moment he and Mr. Martin came
in sight of the ice-house, and they saw who
was doing it. There stood Teddy and Jan,
first hauling up on the end of a long rope,
and then letting it run through their hands
again. On the other end of the rope, as it
ran over the pulley wheel at the roof of the
ice-house, was Baby William.</p>

<p>The rope was tied about his waist, and
every time the Curlytops pulled on the rope
their little brother was hoisted up in the air,
swaying and dangling about as a spider does
on the end of the web he spins. And when
Ted and Jan let the rope slip through their
fingers, Trouble was lowered toward the
ground.</p>

<p>The Curlytops were quite strong for their
age, having played out of doors so much, and
Trouble was not very heavy. The rope
slipped easily over the wooden wheel, or pulley,
and so it was that Ted and Jan could
very easily raise and lower their little
brother. They had tied the rope around his
waist. Ted was pretty good at tying knots,
for Uncle Ben had showed him how.</p>

<p>“Children! Children! What are you doing?”
cried Mrs. Martin, as, with her husband
and Uncle Ben, she came in front of
the ice-house.</p>

<p>“Theodore, Janet, stop it at once!” cried
their father.</p>

<p>“Lower him easy now! Don’t let him
come down too hard!” was what Uncle Ben
said. And he said it just in time, too. For
Ted and Jan were so surprised at being
called to in this sudden way that they might
have let go of the rope while Trouble was
hoisted in the air, and then the little chap
would have had a hard fall.</p>

<p>But Uncle Ben knew what he was doing,
and no sooner had he called out than he ran
beneath the dangling little boy and caught
him in his arms as Ted and Jan lowered him.</p>

<p>“There you are!” cried Uncle Ben, as he
loosed the loop of rope from around Trouble’s
little stomach and set Baby William
on the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted! Jan! What were you doing?”
asked their mother. “What were you thinking
of?”</p>

<p>“We were just playing Trouble was a cake
of ice,” said Janet, as she let go her hold of
the rope.</p>

<p>“And we gave him a ride up and down in
the air,” added Teddy.</p>

<p>“Me ’iked it!” declared Trouble himself,
as he laughed and clapped his hands. “Me
went up and me went down!”</p>

<p>“I should say you did!” said his mother.
“It’s a mercy you didn’t fall. Don’t ever do
such a thing again, Ted and Jan.”</p>

<p>“No’m. We won’t!” they promised.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, if he did fall, or the rope broke,
he wouldn’t have hurt himself much,” said
Teddy, after thinking the matter over. “The
ground is all sawdust here, and he’d fall on
that. Besides we didn’t pull him up very
high. Did we, Jan?”</p>

<p>“No, not high at all,” she agreed.</p>

<p>“And I tied the rope around his stomach
good and tight so it wouldn’t slip,” went on
Teddy. “I tied the rope the way you
showed me, Uncle Ben.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not going to show you how to
tie any more knots if you use a rope on your
little brother,” said Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>Teddy thought that over, and decided he
wanted to know more about ropes and knots,
and as, moreover, their father and mother
said the Curlytops must not do it again, that
was the first and last time Baby William
was ever hauled up on an ice rope by his
brother and sister. But the Curlytops did
plenty of other queer things, as you shall
hear.</p>

<p>Supper over that night, they all went for
a sail with Daddy Martin. Silver Lake was
getting to be quite a lively place now. The
merry-go-round was being put up, after having
been stored in a barn all winter, the
shoot-the-chutes were being painted and
made ready for the picnic crowds, and the
other places to have fun would soon be
open. The picnic grounds, as I have told
you, were a little distance from Sunnyside
Bungalow, but it was easy to reach them in
a boat, or by walking around the shore of
Silver Lake.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin had his boats all in readiness
to be hired out now, and a few persons had
come to get them, being waited on by Uncle
Ben, who was in charge. Uncle Ben had
told Mr. Martin it would be a good idea to
put up a little candy and soda-water stand
on the pier, so those who went out in boats
could buy something to eat and something
to drink. So this had been done, and the
Curlytops were quite delighted. For, of
course, they could have all the soda-water
and ice-cream they wanted without paying a
cent—as their father owned the stand. Mrs.
Martin did not let the children have more
than was good for them, though.</p>

<p>Every day the Curlytops had fun at Silver
Lake, and the fun did not always end at
night, for Uncle Ben or Daddy Martin
would take them out on the water either in a
sailboat a rowboat or in the motor launch.</p>

<p>“When are we going fishing?” asked
Teddy one evening, as they were coming
back to the dock after a pleasant sail.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty soon now,” said Uncle Ben,
with a smile at the Curlytops. For Janet
was as eager to start out with hook and line
as was Teddy. “I’ll have to go soon, if I
go at all. For soon the picnic and excursion
crowds will be coming to Silver Lake, and
I’ll be so busy attending to the boats, the
soda-water and the ice-cream, that I won’t
have any time to fish.”</p>

<p>As I have told you, Uncle Ben was to be
in charge of Mr. Martin’s dock at the lake,
and the old sailor was to have a man and a
boy to help him. The man had come, but
the boy had not yet been hired. Mr. Martin
spent many days at Sunnyside Bungalow, at
Silver Lake, as he had some one he could
leave in charge of his store at Cresco.</p>

<p>One day, after dinner, Ted had found
some string that came off a package of groceries.
He took out the knots, fastened one
end of the cord on a stick which he found in
the woods, and cried:</p>

<p>“Where’s Uncle Ben? I want to go fishing
now, but I haven’t got a hook. Come on,
Uncle Ben, let’s go fishing!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was reading a letter, and
when she finished it she looked at the clock
and said:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go fishing just now, Teddy.”</p>

<p>“Why not, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought perhaps you and Jan
would like to go in the motor boat over to
the Point to meet the train.”</p>

<p>“Go to the Point to meet the train!” cried
Ted. “Is anybody we know coming on the
train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” and Mrs. Martin smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, who is it?” cried Ted and Janet together.
For when their mother smiled in
that queer way they knew something good
was in store for them.</p>

<p>“Well, the other day I wrote a letter, inviting
some company to come here to visit
us,” she said. “Just now I have their answer
and they are coming on the eleven-o’clock
train. Uncle Ben is going over to
the Point to meet it, and I thought you would
like to go with him. But if you would rather
go fishing——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Ted. “We want to see
the company; don’t we, Jan?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Who is it?”</p>

<p>“See if you can’t guess. I’m not going to
tell you,” said Mrs. Martin with a laugh.</p>

<p>Well, the Curlytops guessed. Grandpa
Martin? Uncle Prank? Aunt Jo? But
their mother only shook her head after each
guess.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait and see,” she told
them.</p>

<p>So you can well imagine how excited Ted
and Janet were when they got ready to go
over to the Point in the motor boat with
Uncle Ben to meet the company that was to
come to camp. The Point was the nearest
railroad station for Silver Lake, and it was
on the other side of the sparkling water from
where Sunnyside Bungalow was built.</p>

<p>“Do you know who is coming, Uncle
Ben?” asked Ted, as he and his sister took
their seats in the launch.</p>

<p>“Oh, please tell us!” begged Jan. “That
is, if it isn’t a secret and you didn’t promise
not to tell.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a secret. But I didn’t promise
not to tell, for your mother didn’t tell me
who was coming,” said Uncle Ben. “She
just said I was to take the boat, go over to
the Point, meet the train and bring the company
back to camp.”</p>

<p>“But how are you going to know who to
bring if you don’t know who is coming?”
asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, your mother said you’d know who it
was as soon as you saw them,” said Uncle
Ben, with a smile.</p>

<p>And Ted and Janet did. For no sooner
did the train puff into the station and the
passengers begin to get off than the Curlytops
spied a boy and a girl of about their
own ages.</p>

<p>“There’s Tom Taylor!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“And Lola, his sister, too!” fairly shouted
Janet. “Oh, they’re our company!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” yelled Ted and
Janet.</p>

<p>Tom and Lola, seeing their playmates,
whose mother had invited them to spend
part of their vacation at Silver Lake, rushed
down the depot platform.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t we have fun!” cried Ted,
capering about Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t we!” agreed Tom, dancing up
and down. “And Ted, I’ve got a secret!”</p>

<p>“You have? What is it?”</p>

<p>“I know where your dog Skyrocket is!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />CATCHING FISH</h2>
</div>

<p>What Tom told Teddy as the two boys
danced around on the railroad station platform
was the second surprise of the day for
the Curlytops. The first was in seeing the
two Taylor children who had come to visit
them at Sunnyside. And the second was
when Tom said:</p>

<p>“I know where Skyrocket is!”</p>

<p>Of course that was enough to make Ted
and Janet open their eyes very wide and look
closely at their little friend.</p>

<p>“Did you bring Skyrocket with you?”
asked Janet eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I couldn’t do that,” explained
Tom. “Anyhow, a man had him. He was a
gypsy man, and he had Skyrocket in a red
wagon with a lot of looking-glass on the outside.
I mean the wagon had looking-glass on
the outside—not Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“I know that!” cried Ted. “I’ve seen
gypsy wagons before. But go on! Tell me
about Skyrocket! Where is he?”</p>

<p>But Uncle Ben stepped up just then and
asked:</p>

<p>“Are you two little visitors all alone? Did
any one come with you? Shall I look for
your father or mother in the crowd?” For
there was quite a crowd of people who got
off the train at the Point, and many of them
had come either on an excursion or to spend
a vacation at Silver Lake.</p>

<p>“We came all alone,” explained Tom.
“The conductor took care of my sister and
me. We got here all right.”</p>

<p>“And they know where Skyrocket is!”
cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t zactly know where he is
now,” said Tom Taylor. “But I saw him,
and so did Lola.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we saw him in a gypsy wagon,”
added Tom’s sister.</p>

<p>“Tell us all about it!” begged Janet, very
much excited.</p>

<p>“Not now,” said Uncle Ben. “We had
better get back to Sunnyside. Mrs. Martin
will want to know that you two youngsters
arrived safely. You can talk about Skyrocket
on the way home in the boat. But
I had better see the conductor and tell him
I have his two little travelers safe. Just
wait here for me.”</p>

<p>The two Curlytops and their friends were
so excited and glad to see each other that
they could not possibly stand still. They
danced around in circles, they looked at one
another, and they talked so fast and had so
much to say to one another that it is a wonder
they ever finished.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben soon came back, saying he had
seen the conductor, who was glad to know
that Tom and Lola had met their friends
from Silver Lake. The train journey from
Cresco was not a long one, and children often
traveled in the care of the train conductors,
when their fathers or mothers had no time to
go along.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have packs of fun!” cried Ted
to Tom, as they started for the gasolene
launch. “We have a bungalow, and a tent,
and lots of boats and there’s a merry-go-round
and a shoot-the-chutes, and——”</p>

<p>“And we’re going fishing,” broke in Jan.
“And Uncle Ben is going to show me how to
sail a boat, and I got stuck in the mud and
we played Trouble was a cake of ice and—and—everything!”</p>

<p>She had to stop then, she was so out of
breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, that’s great!” cried Tom. “Your
mother was awful good to ask us to come out
and have a vacation here.”</p>

<p>“And we didn’t know a thing about it till
we saw you get off the train,” said Teddy.
“And now tell us about Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Where is he?” asked the little
Curlytop girl.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know where he is now,”
Tom said. “We saw him just when we were
at the station in Cresco waiting for the train.
A gypsy wagon came along—all looking-glass
and painted red, you know—and I
heard a bark inside, a dog’s bark.”</p>

<p>“I heard it, too,” said Lola, “and I said
it sounded just like your dog Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she said that,” agreed Tom. “And
then we were going to run out to the wagon
to see, and, all of a sudden, a dog stuck his
head out the back door and it was Skyrocket!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Uncle Ben, as he
steered the boat out into the open lake, and
pointed the bow toward Sunnyside. “There
are lots of dogs that may look like Skyrocket,
you know.”</p>

<p>“This was Skyrocket all right!” declared
Tom. “I whistled to him and called his
name.”</p>

<p>“And he wagged his tail, just like Skyrocket
used to,” declared Lola. “And then
Tom and I were going to run after the wagon
and get your dog for you, but then our train
came and we had to get on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Janet. “Then the
gypsy has our dog.”</p>

<p>“Well, I told Mr. Whitter, the station
agent, about it,” said Tom. “He said he’d
try to find out where the Gypsy wagon was
going, and then he’d let you know.”</p>

<p>“Do the gypsies ever camp near Cresco?”
asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“They used to,” said Tom. “They sold
horses and the gypsy women told fortunes
and they had a lot of dogs.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might be that your Skyrocket
was taken from the woodshed that night by
a prowling gypsy,” said Uncle Ben. “You
can have your father write to Mr. Whitter,
Ted, and ask if the gypsies are camping near
Cresco this year. If they are we’ll go there
and see if they have Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll be good to him,” murmured
Janet.</p>

<p>“I wish he had jumped out of the gypsy
wagon when you saw him,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“So do I!” agreed Tom. “If he had, Lola
and I could ’a’ brought him along with us in
the train.”</p>

<p>“Did they catch the burglars that got in
Miss Ransom’s store?” asked Teddy, when
the boat was nearing the bungalow dock.
“And did she ever get back the funny box
with the secret drawer?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t b’lieve she ever did,” said
Tom. “Anyhow, I didn’t hear anything
about that. I’ve just been thinking about
coming out here to see you and Jan and have
fun.”</p>

<p>A little later the motor boat stopped at
the pier in front of the Sunnyside bungalow,
and Tom and Lola were being made welcome
by Mrs. Martin and Nora. Daddy Martin
had gone to town to see about ordering some
things for his soda-water stand.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this great?” cried Ted to Tom,
when the two boys had a chance to roam
about the woods near the bungalow.</p>

<p>“It’s just dandy!” cried Tom. “I could
live here forever!”</p>

<p>“We’ll get our dolls and take them for a
walk in the woods,” said Janet to Lola.
“You brought a doll, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I brought my three best ones.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then we can have a lovely time, and
play parties and all like that. What is it,
Trouble?” Janet asked, for Baby William
was pulling at her dress.</p>

<p>“I want some, too!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Some what?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Trouble want ’ovey time!” he answered.</p>

<p>“Well, you come with Janet and I’ll get
you a sugar cookie,” said his sister. “Then
you can have a lovely time eating it.”</p>

<p>He was soon satisfied with a cookie his
mother gave him, and a little lunch was also
set out for Tom and Lola. And of course
Ted and Jan had to have some, too. So there
was a lovely, jolly time almost as soon as
the visitors reached Sunnyside.</p>

<p>“How get on your old clothes,” said Ted
to Tom, after they had finished the simple
meal, “and we’ll go off into the woods and
have a lot of fun.”</p>

<p>“But be careful!” cautioned Mrs. Martin.
“Don’t go in the boats unless Uncle
Ben is with you, don’t fall in the mud, don’t
play that Trouble is a cake of ice and—— Dear me!”
she exclaimed to Nora, “there are
so many things to tell the children <i>not</i> to do
that I can’t remember half of them.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be good!” promised Ted.</p>

<p>Soon he and his boy chum were roaming
about in the woods and over to the picnic
grounds, which would soon be open to parties
from Cresco and other villages and cities.
Lola and Janet got out their dolls, and
had a play party. Trouble played about in
a pile of white sand that Uncle Ben had put
in front of the bungalow in a shady spot for
the little fellow. So all the boys and girls
were having a good time.</p>

<p>During the next two days everything
opened at Silver Lake. The merry-go-round
started with its organ that played the same
tunes over and over again, the shoot-the-chutes
and the roller coaster were in operation,
and then the excursion parties and picnics
arrived. Sometimes the Curlytops, with
Tom and Lola, went over to the picnic
grounds, but more often they played around
Sunnyside, or went out in the boat with
Uncle Ben or Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>With the coming of the picnic parties
Uncle Ben was kept busy, as were his two
helpers—a man and a boy—in hiring out
boats, attending the ice-cream and soda-water
stand, and in doing other things. But
still Uncle Ben had time to take the Curlytops
and their two little friends for many a
sail, row, or trip in the motor boat. He also
went with them on little journeys back into
the woods. Sometimes Trouble was taken
along.</p>

<p>Tom told Mr. Martin about having seen a
dog that looked exactly like Skyrocket in the
Gypsy wagon, and Ted’s father wrote to Mr.
Whitter, the station agent, asking him to
find out if any of the queer folk, who lived
in red wagons, with looking-glasses on the
sides, were camping near Cresco.</p>

<p>One day, when no picnic parties were expected,
and when Uncle Ben was not going
to be very busy, he said:</p>

<p>“How would you like some fish to-morrow,
Mrs. Martin?”</p>

<p>“I’d like them very much,” answered the
mother of the Curlytops. “Do you think
you could catch any in Silver Lake?”</p>

<p>“I might try,” answered Uncle Ben, with
a funny wink of one eye. “But I think I’d
need some help. There are pretty big fish
in the lake, and perhaps I couldn’t pull one
out all alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me come!” cried Ted, who heard
what was being said.</p>

<p>“Can’t I go?” shouted Tom.</p>

<p>“I want to fish!” added Janet, while Lola
looked up from the floor where she and Jan
were playing jackstones.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we can get up a regular
fishing party,” said Uncle Ben, with a laugh.
“What do you say, Mrs. Martin; shall I take
the Curlytops fishing?”</p>

<p>“You might,” was the answer. “If you
bring home enough I’ll have Nora cook them
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie! We’re going fishing!” cried
Ted.</p>

<p>“I hope I get a big one!” sang out Tom.</p>

<p>“I never caught a fish,” confessed Lola.</p>

<p>“It’s fun,” said Janet, who had often
gone fishing with her father and brother.</p>

<p>A little later the four children were out
in the motor boat with Uncle Ben, ready for
fishing. Trouble had been left on shore with
his mother, as it was thought that he would
be in the way.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll anchor the boat here,” said
Uncle Ben, when they had gone about half way
across Silver Lake. “I think this will
be a good place to catch fish.”</p>

<p>So the anchor—which in itself was like a
big fish-hook, only with two sharp points to
it instead of one—was thrown overboard,
being made fast to a rope that was tied to
the motor boat. The anchor kept the boat
from drifting away.</p>

<p>Soon Uncle Ben had baited four hooks for
the children and tossed them over the side.
Then he baited his own and they were all
ready to catch fish.</p>

<p>“How are you going to tell when you get
one?” asked Lola.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll feel something pulling on the
line,” said her brother. “But you must keep
still, Lola! Fish don’t like to hear you
talk.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they?” asked the little girl. “Our
parrot likes to hear me talk.”</p>

<p>“Well, a parrot isn’t a fish,” went on Tom.
“You must keep still. Mustn’t she, Uncle
Ben?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t good to make too much noise
when you’re fishing,” was the answer,
“though if you talk in low voices it doesn’t
so much matter. Now let’s see who’ll catch
the first fish.”</p>

<p>For a time no one spoke. The Curlytops
and their two little guests eagerly watched
their lines, and, now and again, one or another
of the children would pull theirs up to
see if they had a fish.</p>

<p>“Don’t pull up until you feel a good
nibble,” said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>There was another wait, and then suddenly
Tom whispered:</p>

<p>“I have a big bite!”</p>

<p>The next instant Ted called:</p>

<p>“Oh, so have I!”</p>

<p>Tom was fishing from the left side of the
boat, and Ted from the right. As they raised
their poles Lola and Janet saw that both
lines were stretched tight.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re big fish!” exclaimed Janet.</p>

<p>“Pull up! Pull up!” called Uncle Ben.
“Land your fishes, boys!”</p>

<p>Tom pulled and so did Ted. Their poles
bent with the strain, but neither one could
seem to get the fish he had caught into the
boat.</p>

<p>“They must be regular whales!” cried Ted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXIV' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XIV<br /><br />THE GROWLERY HOLE</h2>
</div>

<p>“Pull in! Pull in!” called Uncle Ben
from where he was sitting in the stern, or
back end of the boat. “Pull in your fish,
boys!”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to!” answered Teddy.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” called Tom.</p>

<p>Harder and harder they pulled. Their
poles bent more and more, and their fishing
lines were now straight up and down in the
water.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom turned to look at Ted, who
was back of him on the other side of the
boat.</p>

<p>“Hey there! Look out, Ted!” called Tom.
“Your line is all tangled up with mine!”</p>

<p>“And so is your line tangled with mine!”
added Ted. “That’s why I can’t get my
fish in!”</p>

<p>Both little boys had turned and were
looking at one another. All of a sudden
Uncle Ben began to laugh.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ted, who
was red in the face from pulling so hard on
his pole.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s got to help me get my
fish!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Neither one of you has a fish,” said Uncle
Ben, with another laugh. “Your hooks and
lines tangled together under the boat and
you have been pulling one against the other.
Ted was pulling on Tom’s line and Tom was
pulling on Ted’s line. Take it easy, now, and
I’ll untangle your lines.”</p>

<p>The two little boys looked at one another
and then at Uncle Ben. Then they laughed,
and so did Lola and Janet.</p>

<p>As Ted and Tom lowered their poles their
lines were no longer stretched tight. Then
Uncle Ben pulled on Tom’s line and drew it
from the water beneath the motor boat. And
just as he had said, Tom’s hook was caught
in Ted’s line. The two cords were snarled
together, and it was no wonder each lad felt
that he had a big fish when, the truth was, he
was only pulling against his friend on the
other side of the boat.</p>

<p>“There! Now you’re all right once more,
and you can throw in again,” said Uncle
Ben, when he had finished the untangling.
“Better move a little farther apart. Ted,
you come back here to the stern, and Tom,
you go forward to the bow. Then your lines
won’t be so likely to get crossed under the
boat.”</p>

<p>As the two boys started to separate Lola
gave a cry.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a fish! I’ve got a fish!” she
shouted.</p>

<p>There was no doubt but she had. Something
under the water was fast to the hook
on her line and was darting to and fro, making
the cord cut through the little waves.</p>

<p>“Pull in! Pull in!” cried Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” shrieked Lola, and she pulled
and she pushed, but most of all she waved
her pole in the air—she was so excited, you
see—and she was just about to drop her pole,
when her brother grabbed it.</p>

<p>“You’ll lose your fish if you don’t pull it
in!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“All right, you do it!” gasped his sister.
And Tom was very ready to do this.</p>

<p>With a quick jerk of the pole he raised it
in the air. The line came up with it, and
there, dangling from the hook, and squirming
about in the sun, the water dripping
from it, was rather a large fish.</p>

<p>“Oh, I caught the first one! I caught the
first one! I did!” cried Lola, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I had to help you!” said Tom,
as he landed the fish in the bottom of the
boat, where it flapped about.</p>

<p>“Well, we both caught it, then,” said Lola,
with a laugh. “We can write and tell mother
we each caught half a fish.”</p>

<p>“Next time you get a bite pull it in yourself,
and then you’ll catch a whole fish,”
said Uncle Ben. “Look!” And with that
Uncle Ben showed the little girl how she
should handle the rod when trying to land a
fish.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the first catch
had quieted down, the boys and girls threw
in their baited hooks again, and Ted caught
the next fish. It was not quite as large as
Lola’s, but it was a good fish, Uncle Ben
said. Then Janet caught one, and pulled it
in herself.</p>

<p>Soon after that Lola felt a nibble. This
time she pulled up quickly, and she had a
fish herself—almost as big as the first one she
had caught.</p>

<p>“Now I got one all myself!” she cried.
“Didn’t I, Uncle Ben?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you landed that one all alone—no
more half fish for you!” agreed the old
sailor.</p>

<p>The fishing in Silver Lake was very good,
and it was not long before every one had
made a catch, including Uncle Ben. When
there were half a dozen or more fish in the
“cage,” as Ted called the water-filled space
made for keeping the catch fresh, Uncle Ben
said:</p>

<p>“We have enough now. No use to take
more fish than you need. Save some for the
next time.”</p>

<p>Then they had a nice ride around Silver
Lake and got back to Sunnyside in time for
supper. Daddy Martin was there, waiting
for them, and he laughed when Tom and Ted
told him how Tom and he each thought they
had a big fish, when, really, they had only
caught each other’s lines.</p>

<p>But they all had had a good time, and they
said they were going fishing again with
Uncle Ben. Many were the happy days at
Silver Lake and at the Sunnyside Bungalow.</p>

<p>One morning when the Curlytops and Tom
and Lola came in to breakfast at the call of
Nora Mrs. Martin said:</p>

<p>“Don’t go away when you have finished
eating, my dears. I want you to stay around
the house.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ted. “May Tom and I go
off into the woods? We heard a dog barking
there last night, and maybe it was Skyrocket.
Maybe he got away from the Gypsies, and
has come to find me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he does,” said Mrs. Martin.
“I heard that dog barking, too, but it wasn’t
Skyrocket. But the reason I don’t want you
to go away is that we are going off into the
woods for a little picnic, and I don’t want to
have to look all over for you when I am
ready.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are we going on a really truly picnic?”
cried Janet.</p>

<p>“With things to eat?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it would be much of a picnic
without things to eat,” said his mother,
with a laugh. “Yes, it’s going to be a truly
real one. So don’t go too far away!”</p>

<p>“I guess not!” exclaimed Tom, with a
laugh. “I like picnics!”</p>

<p>“Specially the kind where you have things
to eat!” added Ted.</p>

<p>“That’s the only kind of a picnic worth
going on,” added Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Are you coming?” asked Janet. Both
she and her brother had grown very fond of
Uncle Ben, and Tom and Lola liked him very
much, too.</p>

<p>“Uncle Ben is going to take us across the
lake in the motor boat, leave us there, and
come for us later this afternoon,” explained
Mrs. Martin. “He is so busy at the boat
dock that he can’t get off this time. But he’ll
come on the next picnic. Now run out and
play. I’ll call you when Nora and I have put
up the lunch.”</p>

<p>And a little later Mrs. Martin called:</p>

<p>“Come on now, children! All ready for
the picnic!”</p>

<p>Down the hill they raced to the boat dock,
where Uncle Ben was waiting for them in
the motor launch. Nora carried down the
baskets of lunch, and soon the little party
was on its way across Silver Lake to the
picnic grounds.</p>

<p>Of course there were plenty of picnic
places on the same side of the lake as Sunnyside
Bungalow, but Mrs. Martin thought it
would be more fun to take a little trip and
find a new place. You can often have plenty
of fun in your own yard, but, sometimes, it’s
more fun to go to your chum’s.</p>

<p>Over the shining waters chugged the
motor boat, and in a little while it turned into
a shady cove. Up from the shore was a grove
of trees, and when Uncle Ben had landed
with the children and Mrs. Martin, and had
found a spring of water, it was decided to
eat the lunch there.</p>

<p>“But we won’t eat right away,” said
Mother Martin. “Run about and play, children,
and when it’s time to eat I’ll call you,
but don’t go too far off.”</p>

<p>They promised that they would not, and
when Uncle Ben had set the baskets and
boxes out of the boat he started back across
the lake again, promising to come at the close
of the day to take them all back.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin had brought along a book to
read, and, finding a shady spot under the
trees, she sat down on a blanket, while Ted,
Janet, Tom and Lola, with Trouble, walked
around looking at the different things to see.
The two girls had each brought a doll,
Trouble had his rag doll and a big red rubber
ball, which he liked to toss about, and
then run after. Ted and Tom had not
brought anything with which to play, as they
said they wanted to pretend they were boy
scouts and look for things in the woods.</p>

<p>It was when Trouble gave his red rubber
ball an extra hard throw that Tom and Ted
discovered something. Baby William came
up to his brother, after having lost his ball,
and began to tell all about it.</p>

<p>“Trouble’s ball gone!” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, where has it gone to, Trouble?”
asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Me show!” was the answer. “Down hole.
You get hims for me!”</p>

<p>“He’s thrown his rubber ball down a hole,
Tom,” said Ted to his chum, who was following
a bird through the woods, trying to
see where she had made her nest. “I’ll get it
for him, and then we’ll see if we can find the
eggs. But we won’t take any.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t take any,” agreed Tom.</p>

<p>“Now come on, Trouble, show me where
you threw the red ball, and I’ll get it for
you,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“All wite! Me show!” was the answer,
and Baby William put his little hand into
his brother’s. Down one of the woodland
paths Trouble led his brother, and at last
he stopped where a round, black hole showed
just under the edge of an overhanging stone.</p>

<p>“Trouble’s ball down there!” said the
little fellow.</p>

<p>“All right! I’ll get it up for you,” offered
Ted. He stretched out on the ground, and
reached his arm down into the hole, thinking
he could easily touch the bottom, and bring
up the red ball. But Ted’s hand was only
half way down the hole, and his fingers had
not felt the soft rubber ball when he heard
a growl from inside the hole.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried Ted, jumping up in a
hurry. “There’s something down in that
hole besides your rubber ball, Trouble!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Trouble’s ball down there!” said the
little fellow. “You get hims.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a wild animal down there—a
bear or a wolf, maybe!” said Teddy. “I’m
not going to put my hand down again!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Tom, coming
along the path just then. He had given up
trying to find the bird’s nest.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble’s ball rolled down a hole,
and when I stuck my hand in to get it something
growled at me!” exclaimed Ted.</p>

<p>“I wish I could hear him,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“You can hear him if you stick your hand
down the hole,” explained Ted.</p>

<p>“Huh! Think I’m going to get bit?” cried
his chum. “I guess not! But I know how
I can make it growl without that.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Poke a stick down. That’ll do it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Let’s!” cried the Curlytop lad.</p>

<p>They hunted about until they found a
long, smooth stick and, standing on the edge
of the hole down which Trouble had said his
ball had rolled, Tom poked in the branch.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a growl and several
queer little barks.</p>

<p>The two boys looked at one another.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“I should say I did!” agreed Ted.</p>

<p>“It’s your dog Skyrocket,” went on Tom.
“The Gypsy man must have let him go, and
he came here. Then he hid in the hole so the
Gypsies couldn’t find him again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe he did!” cried Teddy.
“Come on out, Skyrocket! Come on out!”
he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer from the hole.</p>

<p>“Let me poke the stick in,” begged Ted,
taking the branch from Tom.</p>

<p>“All right. But poke it easy, so’s not to
hurt Skyrocket!”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Ted thrust in the stick. Once more there
was a growl, followed by a number of tiny
barks, like those of a dog.</p>

<p>“That isn’t Skyrocket,” decided Ted,
when his pet did not come out after being
called again and again.</p>

<p>“What is it then?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” admitted his chum.
“We’d better go and tell my mother. Come
on, Trouble!”</p>

<p>“Trouble want wed ball!” cried the little
fellow.</p>

<p>“I know you do,” answered his brother.
“But it’s down in the hole, and something
always growls at us. I don’t want to get bit,
and Tom doesn’t either. I guess we’ll have
to wait till Uncle Ben comes back. He’ll
get the ball for you, Trouble.”</p>

<p>“All wite!” was the answer.</p>

<p>Then Ted and Tom ran to where Mrs.
Martin was sitting in the shade and the boys
cried:</p>

<p>“Trouble’s red ball is in the growlery
hole, and we can’t get it out!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Martin looked up, smiling at the
three children. She was thinking of setting
out the lunch which had been brought along,
and perhaps her mind was so much on this,
wondering whether there would be enough
for five hungry children, that, at first, she
did not know just what Tom and Ted were
saying.</p>

<p>“Come on, Mother!” cried Ted to her.
“You come and see what it is!”</p>

<p>“Where shall I come?” she asked, getting
up, as Ted tugged at her hand to help her
to her feet.</p>

<p>“Come to the growlery hole,” begged
Tom.</p>

<p>“And me want my wed ball!” cried
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Is this some game you are playing?”
asked Mrs. Martin, looking first at one and
then the other. “Have you taken Trouble’s
ball and hidden it, Teddy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no’m!” answered the little Curlytop
boy. “Trouble threw his ball down a hole.
Tom and I tried to get it out for him, but
every time we poke our hands or a stick in
a growl comes out of the hole.”</p>

<p>“What comes out?” asked Mrs. Martin in
surprise.</p>

<p>“A growl!” answered Tom. “It’s a growl,
like a dog, and that’s why we call it the
growlery hole.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s Skyrocket, Mother!” suggested
Ted. “Please come and see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it couldn’t be Skyrocket,” said Mrs.
Martin. “If your dog were in a hole he’d
come out as soon as you called him. Besides,
how would Skyrocket get here?”</p>

<p>“He might get away from the Gypsies,”
answered Ted. “Anyhow, Mother, come and
see what’s in the growlery hole, please!”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll come,” said his mother.
“But it’s probably only a little squirrel or
chipmunk that thinks you’re trying to hurt
it.”</p>

<p>“Does a squirrel or a chipmunk growl?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that they exactly
growl,” answered Mrs. Martin, “but they
make funny noises. However, we’ll go see
what it is.”</p>

<p>As she was starting back with the three
boys to the place that Ted and Tom called
the growlery hole, Jan and Lola came over
the top of a little hill.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Mother?” asked
Jan. “Is it time to eat?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” answered the Curlytops’
mother. “But it will be soon. I am going
with the boys to look at a growlery hole. Do
you want to come, Jan and Lola?”</p>

<p>“Is a growlery hole nice?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—I never saw one,” Mrs.
Martin answered with a smile. “Tell them
about it, Ted.”</p>

<p>Which Ted and Tom did, in quite excited
voices, you may be sure.</p>

<p>“Is it very loud growls that come out?”
asked Ted’s sister.</p>

<p>“If they’re as loud as thunder I don’t
want to see them!” declared Lola.</p>

<p>“You can’t <i>see</i> growls, you <i>hear</i> ’em!” exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll go, anyway, and see <i>and</i>
hear,” said Janet.</p>

<p>So Lola and Janet went with Mrs. Martin,
Trouble, Ted, and Tom to the “growlery
hole.”</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Tom, after a little
walk. “There’s the growlery hole!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there it is!” added Ted.</p>

<p>They pointed to a small hole under the
overhanging ledge of a rock.</p>

<p>“My wed ball down there!” said Trouble.
“Me want wed ball!”</p>

<p>“All right. Mother will see if she can get
it for you,” promised Mrs. Martin with a
smile. “But first I want to hear the growl.”</p>

<p>“Just poke a stick down, or your hand,
and you’ll hear it,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I think I’d better put a stick down first,”
answered Mrs. Martin. “If there is some
animal there—and there seems to be from
what you boys say—he might bite me. A
stick will be safer.”</p>

<p>And when she thrust down the same stick
that Tom and Ted had used, surely enough
there sounded first a growl and then a queer
little barking noise.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it Skyrocket?” cried Janet.</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” answered her mother.
“It doesn’t sound at all like our little dog.
But there’s some animal there, that’s sure,
and I don’t believe that it is quite as harmless
as a squirrel or a rabbit. I’ll tell you
what we’ll do.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the four larger children in
a chorus.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait until Uncle Ben comes,”
was the answer. “He knows a lot about the
woods and about animals.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Ben get my wed ball?” asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll have Uncle Ben get your red
ball if he can,” his mother told him. “And
now we might as well go back and have our
lunch.”</p>

<p>“But maybe the bear in the growlery hole
will take Trouble’s red ball while we’re
gone,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a bear in there—that’s sure,” answered
Mrs. Martin. “There are no bears
around here.”</p>

<p>They all went back to the little grassy hill
under the shade of the trees, and near the
spring of clear, cold, bubbling water. There
Mrs. Martin set out the lunch on a big flat
stump for a table, and the children sat down
on the ground to eat it.</p>

<p>“Oh! Ah! Um!” murmured Teddy and
Janet when they saw their mother set out
some jam tarts on a little wooden plate.</p>

<p>“You may pass them, Janet,” said her
mother, and Janet, very politely, passed the
jam tarts first to Lola, she being company,
and next to Tom, he being company also.</p>

<p>“Me want jam tart!” cried Trouble, reaching
across the stump-table.</p>

<p>“Yes, you shall have one, dear,” said
Janet, and she passed the plate to him next,
at the same time smiling at Tom and Ted.
They understood what this meant—that Ted
would have to wait until his little brother had
been served. Then came Ted’s turn, and
next Janet offered the plate to her mother.</p>

<p>“Help yourself, dear,” said Mrs. Martin.
“I am not very hungry.”</p>

<p>But the Curlytops were, and so were
Trouble and Tom and Lola. And I wish you
could have seen them all eat! No, on second
thought, I don’t wish that. It would have
made you so hungry that you would go right
out to the kitchen, I’m sure, and ask whoever
was there to make some jam tarts. And there
might just happen to be no jam, you know.</p>

<p>So we’ll pass over that part and I’ll tell
you what happened next. Lola was eating
a second jam tart, and had just taken one
bite from it, when Janet asked her to pass
the sugar. Lola put her tart down on a plate
at her side to reach for the sugar bowl, and
when she turned again to take up her piece
of pastry it was gone.</p>

<p>“Tom Taylor!” she exclaimed, looking
sharply at her brother, who sat next to her,
“did you take my jam tart?”</p>

<p>“Why no, I didn’t take it,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You’re eating one!” exclaimed Lola.</p>

<p>“This is my own!” Tom declared. “Ted
passed it to me; didn’t you, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I gave it to you,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Well, somebody took mine!” cried Lola.
“I put it down to hand Jan the sugar, and
now it’s gone!”</p>

<p>“I think I can show you who took it, Lola,
my dear,” said Mrs. Martin, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the little girl.</p>

<p>“Look over there, on that little stump,”
was the whispered answer. “There is the
little chap who took it.”</p>

<p>Lola and the others looked, and saw a
pretty striped chipmunk, a little animal
something like a squirrel. The chipmunk
was sitting up on the flat stump, and, held in
its paws, was the missing jam tart. Mr.
Chipmunk was eating away as fast as he
could at Lola’s tart, and he seemed to like
it. He didn’t mind in the least that she had
taken a bite out of it. Though of course I
suppose he would rather have had a whole
one.</p>

<p>“There is the burglar who took your tart,
Lola!” said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, did he come up here when I wasn’t
looking and take it?” asked the little girl
who was visiting the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“That’s just what he did. The chipmunks
in these woods are very tame,” said Mrs.
Martin. “I have heard campers say they
would sometimes jump up on the table and
take pieces of bread. The little animals are
so pretty and harmless that no one hurts
them, so they grow bolder and bolder. Next
time put your jam tart down in front of you,
and then you can shoo the chipmunk away if
he comes after it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I won’t have any more jam
tarts,” said Lola.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have some more in another
box,” answered Mrs. Martin, with a laugh.
“But watch out for chipmunks!”</p>

<p>And they did, after that. They watched
the one that had taken Lola’s tart as it sat on
the stump eating it until Trouble laughed so
hard at the queer motions of the striped animal
that Mr. Chipmunk seemed not to like
it, and away he scampered, carrying what
was left of the tart with him.</p>

<p>There was no other accident to the rest of
the picnic lunch, except that a lot of ants
crawled on a piece of bread and sugar that
Trouble laid down for a moment, and some
bees buzzed around when Mrs. Martin
brought out a can of peaches. But the bees
stung no one, and Trouble said the ants could
have his bread.</p>

<p>The dishes were put away—there was no
lunch itself left, you may be sure—and when
the crumbs had been brushed into a little pile
for the birds, and the scattered papers piled
under a rock so they would not blow about
and make the woods untidy, Ted looked down
toward Silver Lake and cried:</p>

<p>“Here comes Uncle Ben!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s our boat,” said Mrs. Martin,
shading her eyes from the sun and peering
toward the boat at which Ted pointed.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll find out what’s in the growlery
hole!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was almost knocked down by
the rush of four eager children at him when
he reached the shore, all crying:</p>

<p>“Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked, when he
had made the motor boat fast to shore. “Did
you think I wasn’t coming?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. But we want you to see what’s
in the growlery hole!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>Then they told Uncle Ben what they
meant, and when Mrs. Martin had nodded,
to show that there was really something in
the story so breathlessly gasped out, Uncle
Ben said:</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll go and see about this. Show
me the growlery hole.”</p>

<p>Eagerly Tom and Ted led the way, hurrying
on ahead of the sailor. Mrs. Martin,
with Trouble, Janet, and Lola followed.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Ted, pointing.</p>

<p>“Me want my wed ball!” cried Trouble.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben looked at the hole. Then he
took the stick which had been left beside it
and poked it down. Suddenly, just as had
happened when the boys and Mrs. Martin did
this, there was a growl, followed by a tiny
bark.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! I know what that is!” said
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>From his pocket he took a heavy leather
glove that he used when he worked around
the motor in the gasolene boat. Drawing
this glove on his hand, the old sailor
stretched out on the ground, and thrust his
hand and arm into the hole as far as it would
go. Then he seemed to be feeling around,
down inside, and a moment later he pulled
something out of the hole.</p>

<p>“Is it my wed ball?” asked Trouble.</p>

<p>“It’s a baby dog!” cried Janet, as she
caught sight of something alive and wiggling
in Uncle Ben’s gloved hand.</p>

<p>“No, it’s a little baby fox,” said Uncle
Ben. “That’s what the growlery hole is,
children—the den of a fox. But the big
foxes are out now, hunting chickens, perhaps.
Only the little ones are at home.
This is one of them.”</p>

<p>He held out a little animal with a sharp
nose, a rather large tail, and very bright eyes
for the children to see. The baby fox tried
to get away, but Uncle Ben held it firmly
though gently.</p>

<p>“Could we take it home with us?” asked
Ted eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s too small to be taken away
from the mother fox,” answered Uncle Ben.
“Later on, perhaps, we can come back and
get one of the little foxes when they are bigger.
I once knew a boy who had a tame fox
for a pet. But after a while it began to steal
chickens from the neighbors’ coops, so the
boy had to let his fox go.”</p>

<p>“Did de fox eat my wed ball?” Trouble
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” answered Uncle Ben. “I’ll
feel around down there and see if I can get
it. I’ll hurry though. There are three or
four little foxes in there, and the father and
mother fox may come back at any moment,
and as they can bite pretty hard when they
try, I don’t want my hand in the hole then,
even with a glove on. I put it on because I
thought there were foxes in the hole, and I
guessed right.”</p>

<p>Uncle Ben gave Mrs. Martin the baby fox
to hold in her lap while he put his hand down
in the hole again. The tiny animal did not
seem afraid now, and it did not try to bite.
The five children stroked its soft pretty fur
gently.</p>

<p>“Here’s your rubber ball, Trouble,” said
Uncle Ben at last, as he pulled his arm out
of the fox hole for the second time.</p>

<p>“Are the little foxes there yet?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“No, they seem to have gone farther back
in the den,” answered the sailor. “And I
guess we’d better put this one back with his
brothers and sisters, so he’ll be there when
his father and mother come back.”</p>

<p>After the children had given a last look
at the little wild animal, Uncle Ben put it
down at the mouth of the hole, and in the
tiny chap scampered, probably very glad to
be at home again. Then with Trouble holding
tightly to his red ball, the picnic party
went down to the boat, talking on the way
of the fine time they had had.</p>

<p>“It was a regular adventure!” exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p>“It surely was,” agreed Ted. “I’m coming
back next week and get a fox.”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” cried all the other children.</p>

<p>Across Silver Lake puffed the motor boat,
and soon they were all at Sunnyside once
more. Daddy Martin was there to greet
them, having spent the day at his office in
Cresco, coming down on the evening train.</p>

<p>Of course he had to be told all about the
picnic and the loss of Trouble’s ball, the finding
of it in the growlery hole, and the way
the chipmunk took Lola’s jam tart.</p>

<p>“How does it look at our house, Daddy?”
asked Ted of his father.</p>

<p>“Oh, just about the same,” was the answer.
“It’s lonesome, though, with you
Curlytops away. I wouldn’t want to stay
in Cresco without you.”</p>

<p>“Did you see Miss Ransom?” asked Janet.
“And did she get back her queer box that
the burglars took?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw her. But she hasn’t her box
yet, and they haven’t caught the burglars,”
answered her father.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see Skyrocket, did you?”
asked Ted.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer, “I didn’t.”</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast Uncle
Ben came up from the little office on the end
of the pier that Mr. Martin owned.</p>

<p>“Some of our rowboats drifted off in the
night,” said the sailor to Mr. Martin. “A
man told me they were about a mile down the
lake shore. I’ll take the motor launch and
go after them. Do any of the children want
to come?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” cried Ted and Janet, Lola and
Tom.</p>

<p>“Me tum too!” cried Trouble.</p>

<p>“I can take them all if you’ll let me,” said
the sailor to Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, take them,” she said. “Now be
good children with Uncle Ben!” she told
them, as they started off.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, we will!” was the answer.</p>

<p>It was a nice little trip down the lake after
the missing boats. They were seen on shore,
just where the man had told Uncle Ben they
would be, and soon the sailor was tying them
to the stem of the motor boat to tow them
back.</p>

<p>While he was doing this, the children wandered
along to a little shady cove, and Tom
and Ted, who always carried fishlines in their
pockets, started to try their luck.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had made fast the last boat,
and he was going in search of the children,
whom he could hear talking, but not see,
when Lola came running up to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!” she cried.
“A big white bird has got hold of Trouble,
and it’s trying to fly away with him! Come
and get Trouble away from the big, white
bird!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXVI' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XVI<br /><br />THE BAD DOG</h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Ben fastened the last knot of the
rope by which he was tying the rowboats to
the launch. Then he glanced quickly up at
Lola.</p>

<p>“What’s that you said?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I said a big, white bird is trying to take
Trouble away,” answered Lola.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t some of you older ones
drive it away?” asked Uncle Ben, hardly
thinking of what he was saying. “Are you
afraid of a bird?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a terrible big bird!” exclaimed
Lola, spreading out her arms like wings.
“It’s awful big, Uncle Ben!”</p>

<p>“Is it an eagle?” asked the sailor. “No,
it can’t be that, either. I never heard of a
white eagle,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is,” said Lola.
“But please hurry, Uncle Ben. Tom and
Ted aren’t there, and Jan is trying to make
the big white bird let go of Trouble, only it
won’t let go.”</p>

<p>“It must be a big white owl!” exclaimed
Uncle Ben, as he started to run, for he now
heard the cries of Jan and the screams of
Baby William. “I’ve heard of big white
owls hurting people, but I thought owls only
flew around at night. They can’t see very
well in daylight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t an owl!” exclaimed Lola, who
was running as fast as she could to keep up
with Uncle Ben. “I’ve seen owls, and they
have big eyes. This bird has big wings and
a big, long neck, and it swims in the lake.”</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t an owl! Owls don’t swim,
I’m sure of that!” said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>He hurried along, and soon he had crossed
the top of the small hill over which Lola had
come to summon his help. Down in a little
hollow on the shore of the lake the sailor saw
Trouble and Janet trying to beat off a big,
white bird that had hold of Trouble’s loose
bloomers with its yellow bill.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben! Come
quick!” cried Jan, as she saw the sailor over
the top of the grassy hill. “He’s trying to
pull Trouble into the water!”</p>

<p>“Bless my hat!” cried Uncle Ben, as he
saw what was going on. “It’s a wild swan.
I’ve heard folks tell about them coming to
the lake, but this is the first I’ve seen here.
Don’t be afraid, Trouble!” he called. “It’s
only a swan bird and it won’t hurt you!”</p>

<p>Quickly Uncle Ben ran down to the edge
of the water and caught up Trouble in his
arms. He had to pull the loose bloomers out
of the big, yellow bill of the large white swan
that had hold of the cloth. And as Uncle
Ben did this the swan spread out its wings
and hissed, just as geese hiss at you when
they think you are going to hurt them.</p>

<p>“Go on away, Mr. or Mrs. Swan, whatever
you are!” cried Uncle Ben, as he held
Trouble safely in his arms. “Go on away!
Shoo! We won’t hurt you and we don’t want
you to bother us!”</p>

<p>Janet had run back from the shore as soon
as she saw that her brother was safe, and a
moment later, putting Trouble down so that
Janet and Lola could look after him, Uncle
Ben caught up a branch of a tree and waved
it at the wild swan.</p>

<p>The big, white bird flapped its wings,
stretched out its long neck, gave a hiss or
two, and then began to flap its wings. A moment
later, with a sort of “honking” sound,
it began to half run, half fly along the top
of the water. And then, suddenly, it seemed
to jump up into the air, and away it flew, its
neck stretched out in front like a yardstick.</p>

<p>“There it goes!” cried Uncle Ben, with a
laugh. “Now it won’t bother you any more,
Trouble!”</p>

<p>“What was that big bird that just flew
away?” cried Tom and Ted, hurrying up
from the fishing cove.</p>

<p>“It was a wild swan,” said Uncle Ben. “I
never saw one by itself before. Generally
they fly in flocks, sometimes eight or ten of
them. They go from lake to lake, often staying
a long while on the same one. But what
did this one do, Janet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lola and I were just dabbling our
hands and arms while we waited for you to
fasten the boats,” answered Ted’s sister,
“and Trouble was throwing little stones into
the water, when, all of a sudden, this big,
white bird came flying down out of the sky.
He made a terrible splash in the water.</p>

<p>“Trouble went up to it, and held out his
red rubber ball. The swan bit at it, and then
it bit his bloomers and tried to pull Trouble
into the lake.”</p>

<p>“And I ran to get you,” said Lola, “while
Jan held on to Trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess the swan didn’t really try
to pull Trouble into the lake,” said Uncle
Ben. “Perhaps the swan isn’t as wild as I
thought. It may have lived once on a lake
near people’s houses. They get quite tame,
and children feed them. The swans will take
bits of bread from your hand.</p>

<p>“Maybe this swan thought Trouble’s red
ball was a new kind of bread, but when he
nibbled it with its yellow bill he thought he
had been fooled. Then he may have pulled
on Trouble’s bloomers to show that he was
angry, or maybe that was his way of asking
for something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Well, he scared me, ’Cause I thought he
wanted Trouble!” exclaimed Jan.</p>

<p>“Bird scared Trouble,” added Trouble.</p>

<p>“And me, too,” said Lola. “I thought
he’d fly away with Trouble.”</p>

<p>“No, he couldn’t do that,” explained
Uncle Ben. “A swan is quite a large and
heavy bird. They have to run along the top
of the water for a little distance, to get a
start so they can fly, just as an airship has
to run along on the ground before it can rise
up. But a swan couldn’t carry off even a
little baby, to say nothing of a boy as big as
Trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it didn’t take him,” said
Jan, as she held her small brother by the
hand.</p>

<p>By this time the swan, flying over the lake,
was almost out of sight, and as all the missing
rowboats had been gathered together and
fastened to the launch, Uncle Ben said it was
best to start back for Sunnyside.</p>

<p>“Tom and I didn’t catch a fish,” said Ted.
“We had some bites and nibbles, though.”</p>

<p>“We won’t wait here to fish,” decided
Uncle Ben. “We can come out in a boat to-morrow.
We’d better get back home now.
It looks like a storm.”</p>

<p>And it did storm that night. There was
a heavy rain and the wind blew very
strongly. But the bungalow was snug and
comfortable, and the waves from the lake
could not reach it.</p>

<p>The Curlytops sat about the table after
supper, when the lights were glowing, and
told Daddy Martin about the wild swan that
had caught hold of Trouble’s bloomers with
his yellow bill.</p>

<p>For two days it rained, and the children
had to stay either in the bungalow or close
to it. No picnics or excursions came to Silver
Lake, and if it had not been that Mr.
and Mrs. Martin and Uncle Ben found many
ways of making fun for the children they
would have passed a dull time.</p>

<p>But the sailor knew what to do to make it
lively in the house when it rained outside.
He made up little games, as did Daddy Martin,
and the Curlytops and their visitors
played them.</p>

<p>Trouble, too, had fun with his red rubber
ball, playing that it was a baby fox and chasing
it as it rolled about the floor under the
chairs.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Martin, too, did her share to
make sure that the children had a good time.
She let them make candy, and, as you know,
that’s lots of fun. The only thing that happened
that was not exactly fun, was when
Trouble sat down in a pan of candy that had
been put on a chair near the back door to
cool.</p>

<p>Luckily for Trouble the candy was not hot,
and all that happened was that some of the
sticks, which Tom and Ted and Lola and Jan
had pulled out so carefully from the sweet,
sticky lump Mrs. Martin gave them, were
spoiled. A pair of bloomers that Trouble
wore were all stuck up, of course, but his
mother said she could soak the candy out of
them in the wash.</p>

<p>On the third day the rain stopped, the sun
came out, and with joyous shouts the Curlytops
ran from Sunnyside Bungalow and
down to the shore of Silver Lake, followed
by Tom and Lola, with Trouble stumbling
after them.</p>

<p>“Now we can go fishing again!” cried
Tom.</p>

<p>“And sailing!” added Ted.</p>

<p>“And we can go in the woods!” said Lola.</p>

<p>“And wading!” shouted Jan.</p>

<p>It was very beautiful at Silver Lake after
the storm. The rain had washed all the dust
from the leaves of the trees, and when the
sun shone on the leaves they were such a
bright green that it was most pleasant to
look at. The showers, too, made more blossoms
come out in the woods, and Jan gathered
a fine bouquet for her mother, who liked
blossoms in the bungalow. But Jan took
good care not to slip into any more bog holes
as she picked the posies.</p>

<p>One day Uncle Ben had to go up to the far
end of the lake, to a small town named Cardiff,
to get some things Mrs. Martin wanted.
Uncle Ben went in the motor boat, and he
took Jan and Ted and Tom and Lola with
him. Trouble was left at the bungalow with
his mother.</p>

<p>“I wonder if anything will happen to-day?”
said Ted, as he sat near Tom in the
motor boat.</p>

<p>“What do you want to happen?” asked
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, something queer—like a wild swan
or a big fish,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe something will,” said Uncle
Ben. “We haven’t got to Cardiff yet.”</p>

<p>On chugged the motor boat, and in about
an hour it was at the village where Uncle
Ben was to buy the things for Mrs. Martin.
The store was not far from the lake, and the
children got out to go in with the sailor.</p>

<p>“Oh, they keep peanuts here!” exclaimed
Ted, as he saw some in a glass case.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re nice and freshly roasted,”
said the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Tom, and then he and
the others looked at Uncle Ben. “Oh!”
sighed Tom again.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess a few peanuts wouldn’t
hurt the youngsters,” said the sailor good-naturedly.
“Their mother didn’t say not to
let them have any, so you may give them a
bag each.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” said the Curlytops and
their friends in chorus, as the bags of peanuts,
still warm from the roaster, were
handed to them.</p>

<p>“Where are you folks stopping?” asked
the storekeeper, as he finished doing up the
grocery packages for Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“At Sunnyside Bungalow,” answered
Ted.</p>

<p>“Got any dogs at your place?” the man,
whose name was Mr. Blake, went on.</p>

<p>“No, we had a dog, but he went away,” answered
Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, he did!” exclaimed Mr. Blake.
“Was your dog a bad dog?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! He was good!” exclaimed
Teddy.</p>

<p>“And his name was Skyrocket!” added
Janet.</p>

<p>“Well, if your dog was a good dog I’m not
looking for him,” went on the storekeeper.
“I’m looking for a bad dog that has been
taking my chickens and chasing my sheep.
He’s taken other folks’ chickens, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Uncle Ben. “So
there are bad dogs around here, are there?
Are you sure, Mr. Blake, that it isn’t a fox?
I found a fox den over in the woods the other
day.”</p>

<p>“No, this is a big yellow dog,” answered
Mr. Blake. “I saw him carrying off one of
my chickens, and one of my men saw him
chasing my sheep early the other morning.
A farmer saw him do the same thing at his
place. I’d like to find out who owns that
dog. I’d make them take him away, or keep
him shut up. I don’t like to lose chickens
and sheep. I ask every one who comes into
my store if he has a dog. Some day I’m going
to find out who has that bad, yellow one.”</p>

<p>Just then a farmer entered the store, and,
as he heard what Mr. Blake was saying, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I think I can tell you where to find that
dog you’re talking about. He’s at a Gypsy
camp about five miles from here.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXVII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XVII<br /><br />A JOYOUS FIND</h2>
</div>

<p>Janet and Ted looked at each other and
then at Tom and Lola Taylor when the
farmer spoke the word “Gypsy.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” asked Mr. Blake,
who was a little deaf. “Did you say you
knew where the bad dog was that’s been chasing
my sheep and taking my chickens, Mr.
Addison?”</p>

<p>“I think I can tell you where you might
find him,” was the answer. “I was driving
past the Gypsy camp the other day, and I
saw a lot of dogs near their tents and wagons.
You know those Gypsies always do
have a lot of dogs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they seem to be particularly fond of
dogs and horses,” agreed the storekeeper,
hearing quite well now, for Mr. Addison, the
farmer, spoke loudly.</p>

<p>“Well, among the other dogs was one big,
ugly, yellow one,” went on Mr. Addison. “I
shouldn’t be surprised but what he was the
one that’s been around your place, Mr.
Blake. And he’s been at my place, too.”</p>

<p>“There may be something in that!” exclaimed
the storekeeper. “It surely was a
yellow dog that chased my chickens, killing
some, and taking others away with him.
And it was a yellow dog that my hired man
saw chasing my sheep.”</p>

<p>“Do you keep sheep and chickens, as well
as run this store?” asked Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have a farm and a store,” answered
Mr. Blake. “And a dog that chases
sheep is a bad animal to have around a
farm.”</p>

<p>“Our dog wouldn’t chase sheep!” exclaimed
Janet.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know that,” Mr. Blake replied.
“Now I think I’ll take a trip over to
that Gypsy camp, and if they have a sheep
and chicken chasing dog there, I’ll get the
constable after them and make them either
get rid of the yellow dog or keep him chained
up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could we go with you?” cried Ted,
almost before he knew what he was saying.</p>

<p>“Go with me? Why do you want to go
to the Gypsy camp?” asked the farmer storekeeper,
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because maybe the Gypsies have our dog
Skyrocket,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe they have!” cried Janet, clapping
her hands excitedly.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you said your dog ran
away,” went on Mr. Blake. And he looked
first at Uncle Ben and then at the children.</p>

<p>“But I saw Skyrocket in a Gypsy
wagon!” cried Tom. “And maybe these
Gypsies have him. Oh, I hope they have!”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said Mr. Blake, as he got up from
his seat on a nail keg to weigh out a pound of
sugar for a barefooted boy who came into
the store. “Hum! Let me hear the whole
story, children. There may be more out at
this Gypsy camp than we think there is.”</p>

<p>So Janet and Ted told how Skyrocket had
been lost, and Tom told how, later on, he had
seen one of the Gypsy wagons going along
with a black dog in it, that looked just like
the Curlytops’ pet.</p>

<p>“And if these Gypsies are the same ones,
maybe they have Skyrocket out at their camp
now,” finished Tom.</p>

<p>“They surely have a lot of dogs out there—I
saw ’em,” said Mr. Addison, the farmer
who had first mentioned the Gypsies. “And
that big, yellow one looked as savage as a
wolf. I’m sure he’s a bad sheep dog. I
think he took some of my sheep and chickens,
too.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll go and take a look!” said Mr.
Blake, the storekeeper, after thinking a few
minutes. “I’ll get my wife to stay behind
the counter to-morrow, and I’ll go up and
look over this Gypsy camp.”</p>

<p>“And may we come and bring back Skyrocket—that
is, if he’s there?” begged
Teddy.</p>

<p>Mr. Blake looked at Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“I wish you could take the children
there,” said the sailor. “How would it be if
we all went in the motor boat to-morrow? I
could run you up to the end of the lake, and
you could go to the camp from there,
couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be the best way,” answered
Mr. Addison. “It’s nearer by water,
too, than by going around the road.”</p>

<p>“Could you come with us to show us where
the camp is, and where you saw the yellow
dog?” asked Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>“Yes, I could go with you,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll make up a party, and go up
to the end of the lake the first thing in the
morning,” decided Uncle Ben. “I’m sure
Mr. and Mrs. Martin will let the children go
if there is a chance to get back Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you can find him!” whispered
Lola to Janet.</p>

<p>“I hope so, too,” replied the little Curlytop
girl.</p>

<p>After a little further talk with the two
men, Uncle Ben took the things he had
bought down to the dock where he had left
the boat, and soon he and the children were
on their way back across Silver Lake.</p>

<p>All the way home Ted and Janet, with
Lola and Tom, talked of nothing but what
they had heard of the Gypsy camp, and they
wondered if Skyrocket would be found there.</p>

<p>“I wish I could be with you when you go
up there to-morrow,” said Daddy Martin,
when he heard the story of the yellow dog,
the missing chickens, and the sheep that had
been chased so hard that some of them died.
“But I have to go back to Cresco the first
thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>“But we can go look for Skyrocket, can’t
we?” asked Ted anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Uncle Ben can take you there,”
his father answered. “I guess, with him and
the storekeeper, and the farmer you’ll be
enough to make the Gypsies be good. And if
you see Skyrocket——”</p>

<p>“I’ll just hug him and bring him home!”
exclaimed Janet.</p>

<p>“Me want to hug Skywocket, too!” exclaimed
Baby William.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait until they bring him
home, Trouble, dear,” said his mother.
“That is, if they are lucky enough to find
him.”</p>

<p>When supper was over and after they had
played about in the woods a bit, the Curlytops
and their visitors went to bed. Trouble,
some little time before, had nodded off to
sleep in his mother’s arms. Mr. and Mrs.
Martin, with Uncle Ben, sat up in the bungalow,
talking over what had happened during
the day.</p>

<p>“Do you really think Skyrocket may be at
the Gypsy camp?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he could be,” her husband
said. “Of course, it may have happened
that the children’s dog was stolen by
Gypsies, just as it may have been Gypsies
that went into Mrs. Ransom’s store and took
her queer box and other things. But it
would be too much to have it happen that
the Gypsies camping at the upper end of this
lake are the same ones who took the Curlytops’
pet dog.”</p>

<p>“Well, it could happen,” said Ted’s
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, it <i>could</i>,” agreed her husband, “but
I don’t believe it will. I’m afraid Skyrocket
will never be found, though I wish he would,
for our Curlytops miss him so much.”</p>

<p>“We’ll know by this time to-morrow
whether or not he is in the Gypsy camp,”
said Uncle Ben. “We’ll start early in the
morning, and make a trip of it. I have to go
over to Cardiff to pick up Mr. Blake and Mr.
Addison first.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll find Skyrocket,” said
Mr. Martin, as he went about the bungalow,
locking up for the night. “But I’m afraid
you will not, and the children will be very
much disappointed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to give them a good time on the
water, in case we don’t find their dog,” answered
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>All was still and quiet in the bungalow a
little later. Every one was fast asleep, and
I am quite sure the Curlytops, and perhaps
Tom and Lola, were dreaming of going to the
Gypsy camp and maybe having their fortunes
told.</p>

<p>All of a sudden came a loud cry that awakened
every one in Sunnyside.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got him! I’ve got him!”
shouted the voice of Ted Martin. “I’ve got
him! He came back to me! He got away
from the Gypsies and now he’s here!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Teddy! Hush, my dear!” called
his mother from the next room. “Wake up!
Wake up! You’re talking in your sleep!”</p>

<p>But Teddy kept on calling:</p>

<p>“I have him! Oh, I have Skyrocket! My
dog has come back!”</p>

<p>“Teddy, be quiet! Wake up. You have
the nightmare!” said his father, and, getting
up, Mr. Martin hurried into the room of his
little son.</p>

<p>Turning on the light, for there were electric
lamps at Sunnyside, Mr. Martin saw
Teddy sitting up on his cot. There was a
strange look on the little boy’s face.</p>

<p>“Where did he go?” he asked his father,
in sleepy tones.</p>

<p>“Where did who go?” Mr. Martin asked,
while Uncle Ben, from his room, called to
know if anything was wrong.</p>

<p>“Only Teddy talking in his sleep,” answered
Mr. Martin. “I guess he was dreaming
he was at the Gypsy camp and had found
Skyrocket; weren’t you?” he asked the little
boy.</p>

<p>“I did find Skyrocket,” was the answer.
“Skyrocket was right here. I felt his soft
fur. He was right in bed with me. Oh,
where did he go?”</p>

<p>Teddy spoke so loudly, and seemed so
much in earnest that his mother came in and
tried to quiet him.</p>

<p>“You’ll wake Trouble up,” she said; “and
you know how hard it is to get him to sleep
again. And you have already awakened all
of us. It’s all right, Tom and Lola!” she
called to the visitors. “It was just Teddy
talking in his sleep. He thought he had Skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“I really did have him, Mother!” Teddy
insisted. “I could feel his soft fur, and he
was right in my bed.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Teddy!” exclaimed his father.
“You just dreamed it!”</p>

<p>“No! Look! Oh, I feel him now!” cried
the little boy. “Here he is in bed with me!
He’s under the covers, down by my feet!”</p>

<p>His father and mother looked. Surely
enough, something was moving under the
bed clothes, and it was not Teddy’s toes that
were wiggling, for they could be seen, sticking
up under the sheet, off to one side.</p>

<p>Daddy Martin, with a quick motion,
turned back the sheet. Out on the floor
jumped a big gray animal with a very large
tail.</p>

<p>“That’s what it was!” cried Teddy. “I
knew I felt something soft and fuzzy.”</p>

<p>“It’s a big gray squirrel!” said Mr. Martin.
“He must have crawled in bed with
Teddy. No wonder you felt something like
Skyrocket’s fuzzy coat,” he added.</p>

<p>“Oh, get the squirrel for me!” begged
Teddy. But the squirrel did not wait to be
caught. It was one thing to be in a soft
warm bed in the dark with a little boy, but
quite another to have big folks looking at
him in the light. So the squirrel scurried
out of an open window and disappeared in
the darkness off the porch.</p>

<p>“There! it wasn’t a dream, was it?” asked
Teddy, when it was certain that the squirrel
had gone.</p>

<p>“No, it was part real,” his father said with
a laugh. “Now go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Nothing else disturbed the Curlytops or
the others in the bungalow that night, and in
the morning after breakfast they started for
Cardiff, there to get Mr. Blake and Mr. Addison,
and then go on to the Gypsy camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter id04">
<img src="images/illus-204.jpg" alt="" class="w100" />
<div class="w100">
<p>“THAT’S WHAT IT WAS!” CRIED TEDDY. “I KNEW I FELT SOMETHING SOFT AND FUZZY.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Did you lose any more chickens, or were
your sheep chased in the night?” asked
Uncle Ben of the storekeeper, when the two
men came down to the dock.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer. “That bad, yellow
dog was around again, and I fired my
gun at him, but I didn’t hit him. He ran
off toward the place where Mr. Addison says
the Gypsy camp is.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon be there and we can see
for ourselves,” replied Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Will it be all right for the children?”
asked Mr. Addison, as he noticed Ted and
Janet and Tom and Lola in the boat.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Uncle Ben. “I guess
we three men are enough to make the Gypsies
be good. Besides, we can have them arrested
if they try any tricks.”</p>

<p>Off puffed the motor boat once more, and
after about an hour’s ride they reached a
little cove, or bay. From there a path led
to the Gypsy camp, Mr. Addison said.</p>

<p>The boat was chained and locked to a pier,
and then the party started through the
woods. The children were very much excited,
looking on each side as they went
along, each one hoping to get the first sight
of the camp.</p>

<p>“There’s the place!” said Mr. Addison,
after a while, in a low voice. He pointed
through the trees. The Curlytops and the
others could see some white tents and a number
of red and yellow wagons, with bits of
looking-glass fastened on the sides.</p>

<p>It was the Gypsy camp.</p>

<p>Eagerly Ted and Tom pressed forward,
running ahead of Uncle Ben and the others.
As the boys came out on a little open space,
around which were the tents and wagons,
Ted caught sight of a small, black dog.</p>

<p>“There he is! There he is!” cried the Curlytop
lad. “I’ve found Skyrocket! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>But, as he spoke, he and Tom saw a big,
dark-skinned Gypsy man with gold rings in
his ears grab the black dog up in his arms
and hurry into a tent with him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXVIII' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><br />IN THE LAKE</h2>
</div>

<p>Just as soon as Ted called out that he had
found Skyrocket, in fact before that, and
while the Curlytops and their friends were
walking through the woods toward the camp,
there was a great deal of excitement among
the Gypsies. The dark-skinned people, who
lived in tents and in funny red wagons with
looking-glasses on the outside, seemed to
think that the coming of the strangers meant
that something was going to happen. And
it was.</p>

<p>“That was Skyrocket! I know it was!”
cried Ted, pointing toward the tent into
which the Gypsy man, with rings in his ears,
had taken the black dog.</p>

<p>“I know it was, too!” added Janet. “Oh,
Uncle Ben, please get our dog back!” she
begged. “That was Skyrocket, wasn’t it?”
she asked Lola.</p>

<p>“It looked like him,” declared Tom’s sister,
while Tom Taylor said:</p>

<p>“Course it was! That was Skyrocket, and
that’s the same Gypsy man that I saw have
him before—the time I told you about.”</p>

<p>“Easy now, children! Easy!” said Uncle
Ben, in a low voice. “We want to be sure
we’re right before we go ahead. If we make
a mistake and claim some dog that isn’t
ours, there may be trouble.”</p>

<p>“I think there is going to be trouble anyhow,”
said Mr. Addison, speaking to Uncle
Ben and Mr. Blake. “These Gypsies don’t
look very pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’d better behave themselves or
they’ll get into trouble,” said Mr. Blake.
“Now then, Mr. Wilson,” he went on, speaking
to Uncle Ben, “we’ll let you do the talking.
If that is the Curlytops’ dog, we want
to get it, and you know most about it.”</p>

<p>“All right then,” agreed Uncle Ben.
“We’ll see what happens.”</p>

<p>Uncle Ben walked on ahead, followed by
Ted and Jan and Tom and Lola.</p>

<p>The children were interested and curious
when they saw a number of not very friendly
looking Gypsy men and women around the
tents and wagons. There were Gypsy boys
and girls, too, but they did not smile at the
newcomers. Instead, the Gypsy children
seemed to be hiding in among the tents and
wagons. And there were some little Gypsy
babies, also, which their mothers carried
about wrapped in shawls. The shawls were
bright green, red, or yellow. Gypsies like
bright colors and things that shine—that’s
why they put looking-glasses on the outside
of their wagons as well as inside.</p>

<p>As Uncle Ben, the children, Mr. Blake,
and Mr. Addison walked along the woodland
path, through the Gypsy camp, they were
met by the same big, dark-skinned Gypsy
man who had taken the black dog into the
tent.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Uncle Ben, in a
pleasant voice, as he stood still. The Curlytops
and Tom and Lola came to a halt behind
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” answered the Gypsy man, and
he did not seem to be very pleasant.</p>

<p>“We called to ask about a dog,” went on
Uncle Ben. “I see you have a number of
dogs here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have dogs,” answered the Gypsy.
That was true enough, for there were many
dogs and horses scattered here and there
about the camp, some behind the tents and
red wagons. “We have dogs and horses.
Want to buy some?”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t exactly want to <i>buy</i> a dog,”
answered Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t give dogs away,” said the
Gypsy, who spoke the same language as did
Uncle Ben, though perhaps the dark-skinned
man could talk in his own special
language, too. “We sell dogs. What kind
do you want to buy?”</p>

<p>Eagerly Ted and Jan listened for what
Uncle Ben would answer, and he replied:</p>

<p>“We’d like to get that little black dog you
took into the tent just as we came along.
That’s the dog we want.”</p>

<p>“That dog is not to be sold!” cried the
Gypsy, and this was more than Ted could
stand.</p>

<p>“That’s our dog!” exclaimed the little
boy. “That’s our dog Skyrocket, and we
want him back! He got lost from our house.
He climbed out the woodshed window, and
we want him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we want Skyrocket!” added Janet.
“He didn’t ever sleep on his new piece of
carpet that Teddy put in his box. Please,
Mr. Gypsy man, give us back our dog!”</p>

<p>The Gypsy with the gold rings in his ears
scowled as he answered:</p>

<p>“I have not your dog! That black dog is
mine!”</p>

<p>And at this Mr. Addison broke in with:</p>

<p>“Yes, and I suppose that big yellow dog
is yours, too!” and he pointed to a large yellow
animal that was sneaking around behind
a red wagon. The yellow dog was not what
you would call a friendly dog. He was more
like a wolf or a fox. “Is that your dog?”
asked Mr. Addison, pointing to the animal.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s my dog, too,” answered the
Gypsy.</p>

<p>“Then you’re just the man I’m looking
for!” exclaimed the farmer. “That’s the
yellow dog that’s been chasing my sheep and
taking my chickens. And he took Mr.
Blake’s sheep and chickens, too! Now then,
I’m a deputy sheriff of this county. As you
know, that’s just as good as a policeman in
the city. And either you’ve got to get rid of
that yellow dog and pay me for the loss of
my lambs and chickens, and Mr. Blake for
his, or I’ll arrest you, and drive you away
from this camp. Now, what’s it going to be,
Mr. Gypsy? I guess you’ll find you have
one dog too many!”</p>

<p>“My dog never kills sheep or chickens!”
said the Gypsy, but he was not as bold as he
had been at first.</p>

<p>“Well, plenty of farmers near me have
seen this yellow dog of yours, and they know
what he has done,” said Mr. Addison.
“Now, either you’ll get rid of that yellow
dog, or you’ll get out of here,” and he spoke
sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, if my yellow dog hurt your sheep
or chickens I didn’t know it,” said the
Gypsy, and his voice was quite different
now.</p>

<p>“I’m telling you about it,” said Mr. Addison.
“And, what’s more, you’ve got to pay
us for the animals and fowls your dog killed.
And now what about this other dog—the
black one that belongs to these children?
Where’s the dog Skyrocket?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the Gypsy. “I
haven’t got their dog.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have so!” cried Jan.</p>

<p>“I saw you take a black dog into the tent.
That was Skyrocket!” added Ted.</p>

<p>“No! No!” cried the Gypsy, getting
angry again.</p>

<p>All the other Gypsies, men and women,
boys and girls, were now gathered in the
middle of the camp, around Uncle Ben, the
children, the farmer and storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Look here,” put in Uncle Ben. “It’s
easy to settle this matter. Let us have a look
at that black dog, and then we can tell for
sure if he belongs to the Curlytops. Bring
out the little black dog.”</p>

<p>“He is mine I tell you!” exclaimed the
Gypsy. “I’ve had him a long time.”</p>

<p>“Well, Skyrocket has been gone a long
time,” said Janet.</p>

<p>“Bring out the dog,” ordered Mr. Addison,
and he showed the shiny, nickel badge
he wore on his vest, to prove that he was a
deputy sheriff; a man who can arrest
people.</p>

<p>“I show you that not your dog!” said the
Gypsy. “I show you!”</p>

<p>Quickly he went into the tent, and in a
moment he came out with a little black dog
in his arms. It was a dog much smaller than
Skyrocket, and of a different breed.</p>

<p>“That your dog?” cried the Gypsy, holding
out the small black poodle.</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t Skyrocket,” said Teddy,
in a sad voice.</p>

<p>“What I tell you?” demanded the dark-skinned
man.</p>

<p>Janet looked disappointed. Mr. Blake,
who had not spoken since entering the Gypsy
camp, now stepped forward and called out:</p>

<p>“I saw you take a black dog into that tent,
and this isn’t the same dog. You have another
black one there. Here, I’ll take a
look!”</p>

<p>Before any of the Gypsies could stop him
Mr. Blake pressed forward, passed the man
with the gold rings in his ears, and a moment
later the storekeeper was inside the tent.
Some one else inside it gave a frightened cry,
and then there sounded the excited barking
of a dog.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” cried Mr. Blake, and in
another instant out of the tent he stepped,
and in his arms was a wildly struggling
black dog.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Skyrocket! That’s Skyrocket!”
cried Teddy, springing forward.</p>

<p>“That’s our dog!” echoed Janet, and she
and her brother both tried at once to take
the wiggling animal from the arms of Mr.
Blake.</p>

<p>The Gypsy man, with a scowl on his face,
started forward, but he was caught by Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” exclaimed the sailor.
“Take it easy now. Whose dog is that?”
and he pointed to the larger black one which
was now trying to jump into the arms of
both Ted and Janet at the same time, meanwhile
wagging his tail as if he would wag it
off, and barking and whining, so glad was
he to see the Curlytops again.</p>

<p>“That’s my dog!” answered the Gypsy.
“I have had him a long while.”</p>

<p>“Your dog, is it?” asked Uncle Ben.
“Well, we’ll see about this. Put him on the
ground, Jan, and we’ll see who he goes to.
Put the dog down, Teddy!”</p>

<p>It was hard work to do this, for the black
animal was frisking around the Curlytops,
crazy with joy. But at last the dog was
made to stand still for a second or two,
though he kept on wagging his tail and looking
from Ted to Janet and from Janet to
Ted as if he feared to lose sight of them for
a moment.</p>

<p>“Now then, Mr. Gypsy, you call this dog,
and see if he’ll come to you,” ordered Uncle
Ben. “Call him to you.”</p>

<p>“Here, Jack! Jack! Come here!” commanded
the Gypsy, and he whistled and
snapped his fingers. “Come here!”</p>

<p>The dog gave one look at the Gypsy, and
then the animal’s tail dropped, between his
legs and he crouched down.</p>

<p>“That dog certainly doesn’t like you! He
is afraid of you!” said Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“He is a bad dog!” the Gypsy declared.</p>

<p>“Skyrocket is not a bad dog!” exclaimed
Teddy.</p>

<p>And then a curious thing happened.</p>

<p>No sooner had Teddy mentioned the name
“Skyrocket” than the dog, which had been
slowly and tremblingly creeping toward the
Gypsy, turned, and, with a joyful bark,
sprang toward the Curlytop boy and girl.
In another instant he was being hugged in
their arms.</p>

<p>“I guess that shows whose dog he is!” said
Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” cried the farmer.
“How then, Mr. Gypsy, what have you to
say for yourself? Where did you get that
dog which belongs to these children?”</p>

<p>“That’s my dog!” said the Gypsy again.</p>

<p>“Your dog! He’s only your dog because
you found him, or took him away from his
home!” cried Uncle Ben. “You’ve beaten
him and made him afraid of you while
you’ve had him, but you sha’n’t have him
any more. Curlytops, that’s Skyrocket sure
enough. He knows his name when you speak
it only once, and he came to you without calling,
while he was afraid of this Gypsy. Now
you have your dog back!”</p>

<p>“And we’ll never let him go again!” said
Janet.</p>

<p>“Now look here, you Gypsies!” said Mr.
Addison in a stern voice. “You’ll be allowed
to camp here just as long as you behave
yourselves, and no longer. Get rid of
that yellow dog that kills sheep and chickens,
and don’t take any more pet dogs and
you’ll be better off. Remember what I say—don’t
take any more pet dogs that belong
to children!” and he shook his finger warningly
at the dark-skinned man.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was their dog!” growled
the Gypsy. “He came to me on the road and
I kept him.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he did, and maybe he
didn’t,” went on the deputy sheriff. “Anyhow
we’ve found what we came after and you
heard what I said. We’ll be on the watch
now. And you get rid of that bad yellow
dog!”</p>

<p>The Gypsy muttered something that no
one could hear, and there were growls and
grumbles from the other men and boys, while
the women, each one of whom wore a bright
shawl or dress, talked among themselves in
the Gypsy tongue.</p>

<p>“Come on now, children, we’ll be getting
back to camp,” said Uncle Ben. “Is Skyrocket
all right, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I guess he didn’t get much to
eat while the Gypsies had him,” the Curlytop
boy answered. “He’s awful thin.”</p>

<p>“And I guess they beat him,” added
Janet. “Skyrocket was never afraid of anybody
before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess the Gypsies didn’t treat him
very kindly,” said Uncle Ben. “But you
can make it up to him from now on. Take
good care of him.”</p>

<p>“We will!” said Janet and Ted.</p>

<p>You can imagine how glad Mrs. Martin
was, and Trouble and Mr. Martin and Nora,
also, to welcome Skyrocket to Sunnyside
Bungalow. It was a new place for Skyrocket,
but he soon made himself at home,
and a little bed was got ready for him on
the porch.</p>

<p>“And if any Gypsies come to take you
away again, I’ll—I’ll scratch ’em!” declared
Janet.</p>

<p>“And I’ll help!” added Lola.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess those Gypsies won’t make
any more trouble,” said Uncle Ben. “If
they don’t behave themselves Mr. Addison
will arrest every one of ’em.”</p>

<p>But from then on there was no further
trouble from the dark-skinned Gypsies, and
the yellow dog no longer chased sheep and
chickens. Either he was sent away or kept
chained up in the woods.</p>

<p>It was two or three days after Skyrocket
had been found that something else happened
which caused excitement at Sunnyside.
Daddy Martin had been back in
Cresco, looking after some business about
his store, and he came to Silver Lake in the
automobile one evening, to stay about a
week, he said.</p>

<p>“How is everything back in Cresco?”
asked Uncle Ben, as he helped Mr. Martin
take some groceries out of the automobile.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” answered the father of the
Curlytops. “There has been another robbery,
though.”</p>

<p>“Was it at our house?” asked Tom Taylor,
who, with his sister and the Curlytops,
was listening to what Mr. Martin was saying.
“Did burglars get into our house as
they did into Miss Ransom’s store?”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t at your house,” answered
Ted’s father. “It was at Mr. Henderson’s
hardware store. Thieves got in there last
night and took a lot of knives, forks, and
things like that.”</p>

<p>“Did they take any funny box, with a secret
drawer in, like Miss Ransom’s?” Ted
asked.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear anything about a queer
box,” answered his father. “But I brought
a newspaper. There it is, Uncle Ben. It
says a big storm is on the way, and may
reach here by morning. I guess we’d better
tie the boats up so they won’t blow about
and be wrecked. There’s a big wind storm
on the way here from the west.”</p>

<p>“Out west, where Uncle Frank’s ranch
is?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not quite as far as that,”
answered her father. “But we’ll have to get
ready for the storm.”</p>

<p>“And after supper will you tell us more
about the burglars at Mr. Henderson’s
store?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied his father.</p>

<p>But after supper was a busy time for Daddy
Martin and Uncle Ben. There were many
boats to be tied fast, or put in safe places.
Trouble stayed with his mother on the bungalow
porch, but Ted and Tom did what they
could to help. Lola and Jan went down to
the dock to help, too. Just how much help
they were I am not going to try to say.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk, and the wind was beginning
to blow pretty hard.</p>

<p>“I think the storm is coming now,” said
Mrs. Martin to Nora. “We had better see
to shutting some of the windows.”</p>

<p>At that moment Lola and Janet came running
up the path that led from the bungalow
down to the dock and shore of Silver Lake.
The two little girls seemed much excited.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother!” cried Janet. “He’s in!
They’re both in!”</p>

<p>“Both in where? And who’s in?” asked
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Ted’s in, and so’s Tom,” answered
Janet. “They both fell into the lake off the
pier!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXIX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XIX<br /><br />THE SHIPWRECK</h2>
</div>

<p>“Look after Trouble!” Mrs. Martin cried
to the two girls the moment Janet told this
startling news to her mother. “I’ll get the
boys out of the lake!”</p>

<p>Down the path she ran, and so quickly had
she gotten up that she knocked Trouble
down. He sat down on the porch, rather
hard, and he was just going to cry, not knowing
what it was all about, when Janet took
him up in her arms.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Trouble! Don’t cry!” she
said.</p>

<p>“Trouble fell down!” said the little fellow,
in a voice that sounded tearful. “Momsie
make Trouble fall!”</p>

<p>“But she didn’t mean to,” said Lola,
thinking to help Janet take care of Baby
William. “Momsie has gone to help get Ted
and Tom out of the lake.”</p>

<p>“Trouble want to go in ’ake!” exclaimed
Janet’s brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Trouble! Two in a lake at once
is enough!” said Janet. “I wonder if
they’re out yet,” she added.</p>

<p>“Uncle Ben and Mr. Martin will have
them out by this time,” replied Lola. “We
forgot to tell your mother that they were
after them.”</p>

<p>And when the mother of the Curlytops
reached the end of the path from the bungalow,
where she could look down to the lake
and the dock her husband owned, she saw
that Uncle Ben and Mr. Martin were lifting
from the water two small, dripping
boys.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve got them out!” gasped Mrs.
Martin, and she did not run so fast now,
for she was quite out of breath. “Oh, I
thought Ted and Tom had fallen in when
no one was near to help them!”</p>

<p>As she reached the pier she saw Ted and
Tom placed on the end of it—Tom by Uncle
Ben and Ted by his father. Water gushed
out from the shoes of the small boys, and
even seemed to splatter from their many
pockets, and both of them were gasping and
trying to wipe the drops from their eyes.
Skyrocket was prancing about and barking
as loudly as he could bark. At the same
time he was wagging his tail, and that was
a good sign, for it showed he knew Ted and
Tom were all right.</p>

<p>“What happened?” gasped Mrs. Martin,
as she hurried down to the dock. “Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” answered Uncle Ben, with a
laugh. “Only wet. And they’ll soon dry in
this wind.”</p>

<p>The wind was, indeed, blowing hard, and
it was bringing a storm with it. The lake
was getting rough.</p>

<p>“What happened, Teddy?” asked his
mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was just a little accident,” explained
Mr. Martin, as he and Uncle Ben
got out of a boat from which they had
reached over and pulled Ted and Tom out of
the water. “The boys were helping us make
everything snug from the storm that is coming,
when Ted slipped off the pier and went
into the lake.”</p>

<p>“And Tom tried to grab me, and he fell in,
too!” added Ted. “Then we were both in,
and we couldn’t swim very well with our
clothes on.” Ted and Tom could both swim
a little, not so very well though even with
their clothes off.</p>

<p>“I could ’a’ caught you if I’d ’a’ seen you
falling in,” declared Tom. “But you went
in so quick!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it didn’t take him long!” laughed
Mr. Martin. “He seemed to jump in as
quickly as a frog jumps in off a log when he
hears a boy with a dog coming.”</p>

<p>“And then what happened?” asked Mrs.
Martin, as she wiped some of the water off
Tom’s face with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Uncle Ben and I were right
here. We jumped into a boat,” said Mr.
Martin, “and reached over and lifted the
boys out. They were trying to swim, but
couldn’t very well. Did you swallow much
water?” he asked them.</p>

<p>“A little,” admitted Ted.</p>

<p>“And I ate some, too,” said Tom. “It’s
better than the ocean water, ’cause it isn’t
salty.”</p>

<p>“Go up to the house now and get on dry
clothes,” advised Mr. Martin. “Uncle Ben
and I will finish making fast the boats.”</p>

<p>“Yes, come with me,” said Ted’s mother.</p>

<p>Ted and Tom went up the hill with Mrs.
Martin, just as Janet and Lola, leading
Trouble by the band, were coming down to
the dock.</p>

<p>“Oh, are they all right?” asked the two
little girls.</p>

<p>“All right! We had a swim with our
clothes on!” boasted Tom.</p>

<p>So the little accident was soon over, and
no one was much the worse.</p>

<p>“Well, now it can blow as much as it
likes,” said Daddy Martin after supper that
night, when they were all sitting on the
bungalow porch. “All our boats are snug,
the candy house on the pier is shut up, and
we are ready for rain or snow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not snow, Daddy!” exclaimed Mrs.
Martin. “We aren’t ready for snow. This
bungalow would be too cold for the Curlytops
to be snowed in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you ’member how we got snowed
in once?” asked Janet of her brother.</p>

<p>“Sure I do,” he answered. “Say, we did
have lots of fun then!”</p>

<p>And those of you who have read about
what took place when the Curlytops were
snowed in will recall what happened to Ted,
Janet and the others.</p>

<p>“I think the storm is coming along fast,”
said Uncle Ben, as he listened to the sighing
of the wind in the trees around the bungalow.
“It’s going to rain, but I don’t believe
it will snow, though it may hail, and
hail stones are worse than snow.”</p>

<p>“Can we throw hail stones, Uncle Ben?”
asked Ted, while he built up a little house
of dominoes for Trouble on the floor of the
porch.</p>

<p>“Well, if they don’t melt too soon you
might throw hail stones,” answered the
sailor.</p>

<p>So they sat on the porch and talked until
it was time to go to bed. Meanwhile the
wind blew harder and harder.</p>

<p>Then, in the middle of the night it began
to rain. But the Curlytops and Trouble,
and Tom and Lola did not know this, for
they were asleep. Skyrocket, the dog, who
slept in a little box on the porch, was
awakened by the storm, and whined. He
was lonesome, so Mrs. Martin let him into
the bungalow for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the Curlytops and
their friends awakened and looked from the
window, they saw how bad the storm was.
It was raining very hard, and the wind blew
in great gusts that shook the trees, and bent
the smaller ones half way to the earth.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at the lake!” cried Ted, as he
pressed his nose flat against the window.
“See the big waves!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to be out on it now,”
added Janet.</p>

<p>“Pooh! I’d go out on it now, if I had
a big boat; wouldn’t you, Ted?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Sure I—well, maybe I would if daddy
went with me,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“We’ll not try it,” said his father. “You
had better stay around here.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go out at all?” asked Ted. “I
have rubber boots and a rubber coat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you may go down on the pier after
breakfast, if some one goes with you,” said
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t I go too?” cried Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. You all have rubber
cloaks or coats and rubber boots,” said Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>It did not seem to rain quite so hard after
breakfast, though the wind was still very
strong. So, when the four children were
well wrapped up, Uncle Ben and Daddy
Martin took them down to the dock to look
at Silver Lake in a storm. Trouble wanted
to go, also, but his mother made him stay
in with her.</p>

<p>At first Trouble cried, but Nora made him
a little paddy-cake, with sugar on it, when
she was baking a pie, and this pleased
Trouble almost as much as if he had gone
out.</p>

<p>“Look at the big waves on the lake!” cried
Ted, as he and the others walked out on the
pier.</p>

<p>And indeed Silver Lake was very rough.
The wind made quite high waves—not as
high as on the ocean, of course, but quite too
high for a small rowboat.</p>

<p>“Well, all our boats are safe,” said Daddy
Martin to Uncle Ben, as they stood on the
pier near the children.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” answered the sailor.
“Hello!” he suddenly cried, as he looked
off across the white-capped waves. “There’s
a boat that isn’t all right, though.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a motor boat in the middle
of the lake. It was being tossed to and fro,
and as Ted and the others looked they saw
something white waved from the boat.</p>

<p>“They’re in trouble!” said Daddy Martin.
“I guess their motor has stopped and
they can’t move. Maybe their boat is leaking.”</p>

<p>“Is it a shipwreck?” asked Ted, who had
heard stories from Uncle Ben about great
ships that were wrecked in big storms on the
ocean.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, you might call it that,” said
Uncle Ben. “Oh, look!” cried the sailor.
“They’re going to turn over!”</p>

<p>As he spoke a big wave seemed to sweep
over the motor boat that was out on the middle
of the lake. Ted, Janet and the others,
watching, saw the craft swing about. Again
they saw something white waved, and a moment
later the boat seemed to turn right
over on its side and some men were spilled
out into the water.</p>

<p>“They’re shipwrecked now, all right!”
cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed they are,” said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go to their help,” cried
Uncle Ben, above the roar of the wind and
the patter of the rain. “We’ll have to go
to the rescue!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXX' class='cfm'>CHAPTER XX<br /><br />THE QUEER BOX AGAIN</h2>
</div>

<p>Ted and Janet, as well as Lola and Tom,
heard what Uncle Ben and Mr. Martin said.
And the same thought came to the Curlytops
and their friends.</p>

<p>“Oh, take us with you!” begged Teddy.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t think of it, my boy,” answered
his father. “There may be hard
work in getting those men out of the water,
and besides, in this storm I couldn’t
dream of taking you little children out on
the lake; could we, Uncle Ben?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” was the answer, and the
sailor ran across the dock to loosen a large
rowboat, in which he and Mr. Martin intended
to go to the rescue.</p>

<p>“But we want to see you save the shipwreck!”
exclaimed Ted. “Please Daddy,
mayn’t we go?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” answered his father.
“But if you’ll promise not to fall off the pier
you may stay here and watch us. You can
see all that happens from here.”</p>

<p>Ted knew it would be of no use to ask
again, so he made the best of it.</p>

<p>“Look!” suddenly said Tom. “The men
are rowing away in a little boat.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the motor boat, which was
now right side up again, but was very low
in the water, as if the waves, washing over
it, had half filled it. And as he pointed
the others saw what he meant.</p>

<p>The two men in the wrecked motor boat,
who had been waving a white handkerchief
as a signal, must have been towing a rowboat
behind their launch. And when they
were tossed into the lake by the storm, they
swam around and got in the smaller craft.
In this they were now rowing away from
the wreck as hard as they could row.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we don’t have to go out
to save them,” said Uncle Ben, who was
loosening a rope that held the largest of Mr.
Martin’s rowboats to the dock. “They are
rescuing themselves.”</p>

<p>“It does look so,” replied Mr. Martin.
“I wonder if they’ll come here.”</p>

<p>While Uncle Ben and Mr. Martin stood
on the pier, hardly knowing what to do,
Ted saw something else.</p>

<p>“Look!” he cried, pointing over the
windy waves. “There’s another motor boat
chasing the first one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a big craft coming from
near the Point,” said Uncle Ben. “And
it looks as if they were going to the wreck.”</p>

<p>Daddy Martin took a telescope from
the boathouse at the dock, and through this
glass, which made things that were far off
seem close by, he looked across the lake.</p>

<p>“The second boat is Mr. Blake’s,” said
the father of the Curlytops. “He’s the storekeeper
at the point. And Mr. Addison, the
deputy sheriff, is in with him. They helped
get Skyrocket back, you know.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re going to arrest the Gypsies
that had Skyrocket,” said Ted, leaning
over to pat his dog, that had come out in
the storm with the children.</p>

<p>“No, they wouldn’t be out on the lake if
they were after the Gypsies,” said Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>“Maybe the men in the wreck were Gypsies,”
suggested Ted. “Look! They’re
rowing away fast!”</p>

<p>This was true enough. The two men who
had been spilled out of the motor boat, which
now seemed to be sinking, were rowing
away as fast as they could.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Blake’s boat is chasin’ ’em!”
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Blake’s boat is going up to the
wreck,” said Daddy Martin, as he looked
through the telescope. “I think we’d better
go out there, too,” he added to Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>“All right. Just as you say,” was the
answer, and the sailor began to get out the
oars.</p>

<p>“We’ll go in the big motor boat,” decided
Daddy Martin. “At first when I
thought we’d have to pick up the men, I
thought the rowboat would be best. But
now I think it will be better to go in the
motor boat. We can get there more quickly,
and if there is anybody left on the sinking
boat we can take them off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t we go if you go in the motor
boat?” begged Ted.</p>

<p>Daddy Martin looked at Uncle Ben, and
then, after a moment, the father of the
Curlytops answered:</p>

<p>“Well, I think if we go in the big motor
boat it will be all right. The wind isn’t blowing
quite so hard now. Tumble in and come
along. It will be all right.”</p>

<p>“And can we take Skyrocket, too?” asked
Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, bring your dog,” said Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>Soon the Curlytops, with Tom and Lola,
not forgetting Skyrocket, were aboard the
<i>Gull</i>, as Daddy Martin’s motor boat was
named, and out over the lake they went.</p>

<p>The men rowing from the wreck were now
some distance away from their sinking boat.
The other motor boat, belonging to Mr.
Blake, the storekeeper, was coming nearer
and soon two men in it began waving their
hands to Daddy Martin and Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>When they were near enough to talk,
Daddy Martin called and asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“A lot is the matter!” answered Mr.
Blake, whom the children well remembered
as having helped, with Mr. Addison, in getting
Skyrocket away from the Gypsies. “A
whole lot is the matter, Mr. Martin. There
has been a robbery at the Point, and we are
chasing after the robbers.”</p>

<p>“Robbers!” cried Uncle Ben, while the
Curlytops and Tom and Lola listened to hear
all that was said. “Robbers! What did they
take, and where are they now?”</p>

<p>“They took a lot of money and stamps
from the post-office,” went on Mr. Blake.
“They broke into it last night, in the storm,
and blew open the safe. The wind and the
rain made so much noise that no one heard
them.</p>

<p>“This morning, when the postmaster came
down to open his office, he saw what had happened.
Then we heard about two strange
men down at one of the docks in a motor
boat, and we thought they might be the burglars;
so Mr. Addison and I came after them.
We’ve been chasing this boat for some time
now, and a little while ago something happened
to it. Maybe the motor blew up. It’s
sinking, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is!” chimed in Mr. Addison.
“Now we can catch the two men who
were in it and find out whether or not they
took the stamps and money from the post-office.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we’re here,” whispered Ted.</p>

<p>“The men aren’t in the sinking boat,” said
Uncle Ben. “We saw them jump out or fall
out, after they waved a white rag for help.
There they go, now!” and he pointed to the
rowboat, in which were the two men pulling
hard toward shore.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! So that’s how they are getting
away, are they?” cried Mr. Blake. “We
saw they had a rowboat tied on behind their
motor craft. Then there came a dash of rain
and we couldn’t see anything more until we
saw the sinking boat. So we hurried toward
it, and then we saw you.”</p>

<p>“Shall we try to catch those two men?”
asked Mr. Addison. “We can easily do it
in our motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Let’s first look and see if they left behind
any of the money and stamps,” said Mr.
Blake. “If we get back what they took out
of the safe I don’t care so much about getting
the men themselves. We can arrest
them later, maybe. Let’s look in the motor
boat.”</p>

<p>So the <i>Gull</i>, in which were the Curlytops
with their father and Uncle Ben, and the
other motor boat, in which rode Mr. Blake
and Mr. Addison, steered toward the sinking
craft. And no sooner had Ted looked over
the side of the boat which was half sunk, than
he cried:</p>

<p>“I see a satchel!”</p>

<p>“And I see a box!” added Janet.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s the post-office stuff!” cried
Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>Going close to the boat, half full of water,
from which the two men had jumped, or been
tipped out, Mr. Blake lifted out the satchel.
It was opened, and inside were stamps and
some money.</p>

<p>“This is the stuff the burglars took from
the post-office!” cried Mr. Addison.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed his friend. “They
didn’t have time to take it with them in the
rowboat.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they were afraid to get the stamps
wet,” suggested Teddy. “Stamps get sticky
in the water.”</p>

<p>“So they do,” replied Uncle Ben. “Well,
anyhow, the robbers left behind them the
stuff they took. Now do you want to chase
after them?” he asked Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>“It’s too late!” said Mr. Addison, pointing
across the lake. “They are going to land
on the shore now, a mile away. We’ll have
to get them later, if we can.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s try now!” shouted Mr. Blake.
“Might as well! Here, I’ll take the satchel
of money and stamps in my boat,” he said to
Daddy Martin. “We’ll keep on after the
burglars, and if you think it won’t sink all
the way down, you might tow this motor boat
over to your dock,” and he nodded to the
craft in which the burglars had been riding
before the accident happened.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the father of the
Curly tops. “I’ll tow this motor boat back
to my dock. But there’s a queer box in it.
Do you want to take that with you? Maybe
that has some money and stamps in it.”</p>

<p>“No, it seems to be empty,” said Mr.
Blake, leaning over and lifting up the queer
box, which was made of wood. “I guess this
wasn’t taken from the post-office,” he said.
“The burglars may have stolen it somewhere
else. We’ll leave that in their boat. Maybe
they stole the boat, too. Tow it to shore, Mr.
Martin—that and the box and we’ll keep on
after the burglars.”</p>

<p>So while Mr. Blake and Mr. Addison, in
their motor boat, puffed on toward the place
where the two men had landed in their rowboat,
Daddy Martin and Uncle Ben fastened
a rope from the half sunken craft to their
<i>Gull</i>. Then they began slowly towing it back
across Silver Lake. But not before Daddy
Martin had lifted out the queer, wooden box.</p>

<p>So much had happened, and there was so
much to talk about, that no one paid much attention
to this box. It was not until the Curlytops
and the others had landed at the Sunnyside
dock that any one thought of the box.
The motor boat from which the burglars had
jumped was made fast to the pier, in shallow
water, so that if it sunk completely it could
easily be got up again. But it seemed to
want to sink only half way.</p>

<p>“My, you’ve had a lot of adventures!” exclaimed
Mother Martin, when she heard all
that had happened. “I wonder if they got
the robbers?”</p>

<p>“No, they got away,” answered Uncle
Ben, who had gone out to a telephone to
inquire. “The robbers got away, but we got
back the money and stamps they took.”</p>

<p>“And the queer box, too,” added Ted.</p>

<p>“What queer box is that?” asked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Why, one we found in the wrecked motor
boat,” her husband answered. “Here it is.
I haven’t had time to look at it.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he handed the box to his wife.
It was square, and made of some light and
finely polished wood.</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Mrs. Martin, as she
looked at the queer box, “do you know what
I think this is?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked her husband.</p>

<p>“I think it’s the same queer box that was
stolen from Mrs. Ransom,” was the answer.
“I remember what she told me about it. I
never saw it, that I remember, though I may
have. But I’m sure this is the same one she
told about as being taken from her store the
time it was robbed.”</p>

<p>“It does look like it,” agreed Mr. Martin,
as he took the box again for a second examination.
“Yes, I believe it is,” he added.
“Then the same burglars that broke into
Mrs. Ransom’s store must have robbed the
post-office.”</p>

<p>“We had better send word to Mrs. Ransom
that we have a box like the one taken
from her,” went on Mrs. Martin. “We could
send it to her, or ask her to come here and
look at it. Maybe the deputy sheriff, Mr.
Addison, would rather we kept the box here
until he sees if he can catch the robbers.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Mr. Martin. “We could
ask Mrs. Ransom to come and visit us for a
few days, and show her the box then.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do that!” decided his wife.</p>

<p>So it happened that, about two days later,
Mrs. Ransom came to Silver Lake to spend
a few days at Sunnyside. The post-office
burglars were not caught, but all the money
and stamps they had taken were found in the
boat which they left after it seemed to be
sinking. But it did not sink, and later on it
was mended and made almost as good as
new. It had been stolen from a boatman
near the Point, and he was glad to get it
back.</p>

<p>In one of the lockers of the boat were
found some of the knives stolen from Mr.
Henderson’s store in Cresco. The burglars
had gone about, breaking into many places,
it was believed. The Curlytops remembered
about the man who had hoisted the sail for
Ted, the time he was blown out into the lake,
and it was thought perhaps he might have
been one of the bad men, but this was never
found out for certain.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson was glad to get back his
stolen knives.</p>

<p>“And I imagine you’re glad to get the
queer box that your brother, the sailor, gave
you, back, aren’t you, Mrs. Ransom?” asked
Mrs. Martin, when the storekeeper had come
to Silver Lake.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I am glad to get it back,”
said Mrs. Ransom. “And I’d be more glad
if I could find my brother who gave it to me—my
brother who has been gone so many
years. But I don’t suppose I ever shall.
Did they find any of my other things that
the burglars took when they robbed my
store?”</p>

<p>“No, the queer box was the only thing they
left behind in the boat, besides the knives,
the post-office money and the stamps,” replied
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, well! I guess I’m lucky to get my
brother’s box back—it has his picture in it,
and some trinkets,” went on Mrs. Ransom.
“And I hear you Curlytops got back your
dog from the Gypsies,” she added.</p>

<p>“Yes, we got Skyrocket back,” answered
Ted. “And we’re sorry we couldn’t get the
burglars that robbed your store.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we can’t have everything we
want,” said Mrs. Ransom. “I’m glad it was
no worse.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ransom turned over and over in her
hands the queer box which she feared she
would never see again. She was very glad to
get it back.</p>

<p>“I declare I’ve forgotten how to open it!”
she said with a laugh, as she looked at it on
all sides. “There’s a secret drawer in it,
and I was just trying to find it. I was wondering
whether the burglars took out my
brother’s picture and the trinkets I kept so
many years. I wonder if the box is empty.”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Uncle Ben, reaching
out his hand for the box. He shook it as he
held it close to his ear.</p>

<p>“There’s something inside,” he said.</p>

<p>“But you can’t get it out unless you know
how to open the secret top and drawer,” said
Mrs. Ransom. “My brother showed me how
a good many years ago, but, I declare! I
seem to have forgotten.”</p>

<p>And then a funny thing happened. All at
once, as Uncle Ben held the queer box, there
was a click, and it opened. A small drawer
shot out, and in it was a picture of a man,
and also some little curiosities, pink shells,
red sea beans and bits of coral.</p>

<p>“There you are, Mrs. Ransom!” said
Uncle Ben. “I’ve opened the queer box for
you.”</p>

<p>“Why, why, how did you do it?” cried the
storekeeper. “I thought nobody but my
brother and I and the Japanese man that
made the box knew how to open it. How did
you know?” and she looked in a strange way
at Uncle Ben. “How did you know?” she
asked again.</p>

<p>“Why, I—I don’t exactly know,” was his
answer in a strange voice. “It seemed to
come to me all at once. I just pressed on a
secret spring, under this queer, carved
flower, and the box opened. As soon as I had
it in my hands I remembered that I had
heard of this box once before.”</p>

<p>“Are you—no, it isn’t possible that you
can be my lost brother!” said Mrs. Ransom.
“You don’t look a bit as he used to look,
though I suppose he has changed after all
these years. But how did you know the secret
of his box?”</p>

<p>“What was your brother’s name?” asked
Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>“John Dowd,” was the woman’s answer.
“Dowd was my name before I married. Yes,
John Dowd was my brother. But I’m afraid
I’ll never see him again. I’m glad to get
back the box he gave me, but I suppose he
has been dead many years.”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t, either!” suddenly cried
Uncle Ben, springing to his feet. “It all
comes back to me now! It all comes back! I
know how I remembered the secret of the
box, too.”</p>

<p>“But you aren’t my brother!” cried Mrs.
Ransom.</p>

<p>“No. But I have seen your brother, and
not less than a few months ago, in New
York when I was sick there. He was sick
in the same hospital; but he got better before
I did, and he left to go on a ship. But before
that he got to talking of different things, and
he told me about a queer box he once owned.
It was this same box, I’m sure, and he told
me how to open it by pressing below the
carved flower. He made a little picture of
the box. It looked just like this.</p>

<p>“That’s how I happened to remember, and
how I knew how to open your box,” he went
on. “As soon as I had it in my hands it
seemed to me as if I had seen it before. But
it was because your brother told me about it,
and told me just how to open it.”</p>

<p>The Curlytops were listening to all this,
and so were Tom and Lola and all the others.</p>

<p>“Oh, can you tell me where my brother is
now?” eagerly asked Mrs. Ransom.</p>

<p>“Well, I can tell you where I saw him last—in
the New York Hospital,” answered
Uncle Ben. “It was there he told me about
the queer box he said he had given to his sister.
But he said he had not heard from her
for a good many years, and he thought she
was dead.”</p>

<p>“And I thought he was dead!” cried the
storekeeper. “And instead we’re both alive—at
least, I hope John is,” she murmured
softly.</p>

<p>“Well, he was getting well and strong
when he left the hospital,” said Uncle Ben.
“Perhaps if you write there, they can tell
you on what ship he sailed. I’m sure it’s the
same John Dowd who was your brother, for
surely there wouldn’t be two of the same
name who had given their sisters queer boxes
with secret drawers.”</p>

<p>“Did he look anything like that?” asked
Mrs. Ransom, as she held out the photograph
which had been in the secret drawer of the
queer box.</p>

<p>“He didn’t look like that when I saw him
in the hospital,” answered Uncle Ben.
“But of course that picture was taken a good
many years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” said Mrs. Ransom. “It’s
been a good while since John gave me the
queer box and sailed away. I supposed he
was shipwrecked between that time and the
present.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was shipwrecked, he told me,”
replied Uncle Ben. “He said he wished he
could find his sister, but as he did not tell me
your name, of course I did not know you
were she.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it will turn out all right
after all,” said Daddy Martin. “We must
write to the hospital and find out.”</p>

<p>And this was done. About a week later
the answer came back, giving the name of
the ship on which John Dowd had sailed.
And, later, when Mrs. Ransom sent a letter
to the place where the ship had voyaged to,
back an answer came from her brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve found him! I’ve found him!”
Mrs. Ransom wrote to Mrs. Martin when the
joyful news came in the letter, for, of course,
she had gone back to Cresco by that time.
“I’ve found my brother! He is in England,
but he will soon be coming back here. Oh,
how glad I am.”</p>

<p>“And if the burglars hadn’t taken the
queer box, and if Uncle Ben hadn’t known
how to open it, maybe she never would have
seen her brother,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“That’s right—maybe I wouldn’t,”
agreed Mrs. Ransom when Teddy repeated
that to her later. “But now I have found
him, I’m almost glad the burglars robbed
me. They can keep the other things they
took as long as I have my brother back.”</p>

<p>In less than a month John Dowd came
sailing back. He was glad to see his sister
again, of that you may be sure, and he was
very glad to meet, once again, Uncle Ben,
and to see the queer box.</p>

<p>“And now everything is found!” said
Janet when the long-missing sailor and his
sister had come out to Silver Lake to spend
a day or two. “We even got our dog back!”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t find the robbers,” said
Uncle Ben. “They got away.”</p>

<p>“Tom and I are going to hunt ’em after
we get back home,” declared Ted. “Aren’t
we, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” was the answer. “And maybe
we’ll find another place they robbed, and get
back the stuff they took.”</p>

<p>“You’d better go and find Uncle Ben and
ask him to take you all fishing!” laughed
Mother Martin.</p>

<p>“Take me, too!” begged Trouble. “Me
want fiss!”</p>

<p>“Yes, take Trouble with you, but don’t
lose him,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ted. “We’ll go fishing
with Uncle Ben!”</p>

<p>They went out in the motor boat, the Curlytops,
Tom, Lola and Trouble. On the
porch of the bungalow sat Mr. and Mrs. Martin,
and Mrs. Ransom and her brother, John
Dowd.</p>

<p>“How strange everything came about,”
said Mrs. Martin. “There was the robbery
of your store, Mrs. Ransom, the finding of
Uncle Ben on our lawn, Skyrocket being
taken by the Gypsies, and the finding of your
brother’s queer box in the wrecked boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and then I found my brother!” said
Mrs. Ransom softly, as she looked at him.
“That was best of all!”</p>

<p>The Curlytops stayed at Silver Lake quite
a while longer, until it was time to go back
to school, and they had many good times on
the water with Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>And now, as this story is finished, we will
say good-bye for a time, though I hope you
will meet the Curlytops again, and hear more
of their adventures.</p>

  <div>THE LINGER-NOT SERIES</div>
  <div>By AGNES MILLER</div>
  <div><i>12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Jacket in full colors</i></div>
  <div><i>Price per volume, 65 cents, postpaid</i></div>
</div>

<p class='ni'><i>This new series of girls’ books is in a new
style of story writing. The interest is in knowing
the girls and seeing them solve the problems
that develop their character. Incidentally, a
great deal of historical information is imparted.</i></p>

<p class='ni mt01'>1. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE MYSTERY HOUSE. <i>or The Story of Nine Adventurous Girls</i></p>

<p>How the Linger-Not girls met and formed
their club seems commonplace, but this
writer makes it fascinating, and how they
made their club serve a great purpose continues
the interest to the end, and introduces
a new type of girlhood.</p>

<p class='ni mt01'>2. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE VALLEY FEUD, <i>or The Great West Point Chain</i></p>

<p>The Linger-Not girls had no thought of becoming mixed up with
feuds or mysteries, but their habit of being useful soon entangled
them in some surprising adventures that turned out happily for all,
and made the valley better because of their visit.</p>

<p class='ni mt01'>3. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THEIR GOLDEN QUEST, <i>or The Log of the Ocean Monarch</i></p>

<p>For a club of girls to become involved in a mystery leading back
into the times of the California gold-rush, seems unnatural until the
reader sees how it happened, and how the girls helped one of their
friends to come into her rightful name and inheritance, forms a fine
story.</p>

<p class='ni mt01'>4. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE WHISPERING CHARMS, <i>or The Secret from Old Alaska</i></p>

<p>Whether engrossed in thrilling adventures in the Far North or
occupied with quiet home duties, the Linger-Not girls could work
unitedly to solve a colorful mystery in a way that interpreted
American freedom to a sad young stranger, and brought happiness
to her and to themselves.</p>
